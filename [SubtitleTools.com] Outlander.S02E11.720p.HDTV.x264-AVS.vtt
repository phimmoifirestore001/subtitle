<i>Previously...</i>

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.574
<i>- Friend of yours?</i>
- Aye, Hugh Munro.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:09.575
Ah!

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.843
Leave her alone!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.113
<i>Mary, she was assaulted and raped.</i>

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.149
She'll be a spinster till
the end of her days.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.917
Judith, you'll pay for your treachery.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.485
Murtagh.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.522
Here we all are, all supporters
of the Jacobite cause.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.325
That makes you traitor to the crown.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.895
Perhaps you have some concern
for this English lady's honor.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.963
All right! I will tell
you whatever you wish.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.632
Strike, and strike hard.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.269
Now we shall not return unless
we bring victory back with us.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:42.975
Angus!

_

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.316
<i>The Jacobite army
had moved steadily south</i>

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.352
<i>during the months since Prestonpans.</i>

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:36.222
<i>We had acquired much-needed
artillery along the way,</i>

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.458
<i>taken the English garrison at Carlisle,</i>

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:42.595
<i>and successfully occupied Manchester.</i>

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.932
<i>Despite this, the anticipated
sympathetic uprising</i>

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.234
<i>from the Scottish lowlands
and northern England</i>

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.903
<i>had so far not materialized.</i>

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.105
<i>We were now encamped
in northern England,</i>

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.908
<i>awaiting further orders
from Prince Charles.</i>

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.016
Ah.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.554
<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:12.091
I am aware how painful
this must be for you,

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.794
but the truth is often vexing.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.329
We must turn back.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.465
And I say we shall not.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.535
Now, London lies within our grasp,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.539
and all we have to do is
reach out and take it.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.107
John?

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.176
This is no time for silence. Speak, man.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.612
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.780
As you know, the Lord General and myself

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.682
are seldom of like mind,

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.519
but I fear, in this instance,

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.621
we speak with one voice.

00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:45.825
I must say, this is a
damned inconvenient time

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.360
to be conciliatory.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.239
And I would say the same
to you, My Lord General.

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:52.598
Fraser, you have proved to
possess a sound military mind,

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.468
but I will not have my decision
challenged by a junior officer.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:56.736
Do I make myself clear, sir?

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.806
And what of our prince's decision?

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:05.444
Do we not all serve him
and his noble cause?

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.148
Our orders were to march into
England and take London.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.752
We are but five days
from reaching that city,

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.720
and now you order us to... to turn back

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.556
and... and retreat to Scotland?

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.558
Five days, gentlemen.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.094
A mere five days is all
what stands between us

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.496
and the completion of God's will.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.632
It's not the five days that concerns me,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.234
but the three British armies

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.802
that stand between us and London,

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.837
and we don't bloody know
where any of them are.

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:36.442
We're not likely to meet all
three at once, My Lord.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.212
But if we are shrewd and lucky,

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.181
we might manage to slip past them all.

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.816
Aye, and if we don't,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.718
the British number 30,000 troops,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.887
while we have mustered a mere five.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:51.424
One good fight, we'd be
too weakened to carry on.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.894
That war brings risk should
come at no surprise.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.696
But if we turn back now,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.132
all hope that currently resides
in the hearts of our supporters

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:04.604
will be filled with doubt and fear.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.806
Is that the one?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.207
Good.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.709
Ah, this won't take long.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.411
I promise.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.286
Ah!

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.688
Ah, oh.

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.457
Good job.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.859
Here.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.527
Dinna fash yourself, son.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:30.396
My guid freen Angus,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.132
he lost his front teeth when
he was no' but a wee lad.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.401
A cow kicked 'em straight
down his throat.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.837
Says he didna shite for a week
for fear o' being bitten.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.850
Right, who's next?

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.421
I came here.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:59.525
I sailed from France to
raise an army, this army.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.429
It was God's will that I
do so, and since then,

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.232
His hand has ever been with us.

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.701
This precious chance of victory,

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.971
if we spurn His divine gift,
there is no guarantee

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:13.906
that it will be offered again.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:20.746
So is there no one among you

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.784
still willing to stand by your prince,

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:27.486
your rightful king,

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.822
and your God?

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.726
One man.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.765
Is that all I can count on?

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.473
One man.

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:27.012
It is intolerable!

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:31.517
I'd rather be run through
by a British bayonet

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.953
and have my body buried
in an unmarked grave

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:37.556
than turn back after
we have come this far!

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.862
But I see now that I am betrayed

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.831
by both friends and allies.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.339
You do what you must,

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:57.610
but may God damn you to hell for it.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.612
I have nothing more to say.

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.716
It's all right, really.

00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:07.661
Not everyone has to get a tooth pulled.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.898
Come on, lad. Move. Move!

00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:12.900
What did you say to him?

00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:14.335
Nothing that isn'a true.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.074
Your Royal Highness.

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.575
Sir.

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.813
Sir.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.831
Sorry, Sassenach.

00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:49.003
I must give the prince some credit.

00:08:49.037 --> 00:08:51.505
Turns out he has a fighting man's heart,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.741
even if his generals don't.

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:56.610
It's not your fault.

00:08:56.645 --> 00:08:59.480
Even if you had talked
them into taking London,

00:08:59.514 --> 00:09:00.981
might not have been able to hold it.

00:09:01.016 --> 00:09:03.184
No.

00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:06.086
But if we had marched on London,

00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:07.922
then things would be different

00:09:07.956 --> 00:09:10.524
to what you said happened
in your history books.

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:13.727
It would mean that just maybe
history could be changed,

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.795
but now...

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.096
My Laird.

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:20.434
My Laird, is it true?

00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:22.536
Are we turning back?

00:09:25.874 --> 00:09:28.509
Aye.

00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:29.887
We're going back across the border.

00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:32.880
Home for winter.

00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:36.016
Are they... are the
British after us, then?

00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:38.018
Are they close?

00:09:38.053 --> 00:09:42.990
I canna say, Ross, but
I'll see you're safe.

00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:45.693
I promise all of ye.

00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:48.128
I'll see ye home to Lallybroch.

00:09:57.873 --> 00:10:00.908
And you, Sassenach,

00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:04.178
I'll see you safe no
matter what happens.

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:19.860
Here you go.

00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:21.535
- That's it, then.
- All right, all right.

00:10:26.248 --> 00:10:28.416
_

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.724
_

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:37.904
_

00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:43.193
_

00:10:47.068 --> 00:10:48.459
_

00:10:51.404 --> 00:10:55.006
_

00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:57.951
_

00:10:59.607 --> 00:11:00.865
_

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:12.813
Hmm.

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:17.929
Are you all right?

00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:19.965
Aye.

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:23.502
Just wanted to watch you
sleep in peace for a bit.

00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:25.771
Hmm.

00:11:27.573 --> 00:11:30.042
Must be as cold as ice.

00:11:30.076 --> 00:11:32.244
Get into bed.

00:11:37.316 --> 00:11:40.218
Hmm.

00:11:41.854 --> 00:11:45.123
What was it that you were saying?

00:11:45.158 --> 00:11:47.626
Ach, nothing.

00:11:49.162 --> 00:11:52.964
There's no' much I can say waking

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:56.702
without it sounding daft
and foolish, Sassenach.

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:03.241
I can say things while you sleep.

00:12:03.276 --> 00:12:05.944
Your dreams will ken the truth of them.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.614
Hmm.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.678
Read this.

00:12:45.318 --> 00:12:46.785
"My Lord Broch Tuarach,

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:48.030
"you are hereby ordered
to proceed at once

00:12:48.054 --> 00:12:49.788
"with your men to...

00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:51.990
"...Inverness?" What's this?

00:12:52.024 --> 00:12:54.025
Exile is what it is.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.027
They want rid of us, of you.

00:12:56.062 --> 00:12:57.362
O'Sullivan fears

00:12:57.396 --> 00:12:59.141
that you have too much
influence over the prince,

00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:01.867
and Murray, oh, he did
naught to defend you.

00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:04.836
They want you and me gone and gone now.

00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.271
Bollock-less bastards.

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:08.306
"Proceed in advance of the army.

00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:11.276
Arrange winter quarters
and obtain provisions."

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.778
Well, how? With what money?

00:13:12.812 --> 00:13:14.880
Oh, aye, I asked O'Sullivan that myself.

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:16.759
He just stuck his big, fat
Irish nose in the air

00:13:16.783 --> 00:13:19.084
and said that His
Highness's loyal supporters

00:13:19.118 --> 00:13:22.320
would of course extend credit
to his representative.

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:23.789
Of course.

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:25.033
I'll speak to the prince myself.

00:13:25.057 --> 00:13:26.558
He's gone.

00:13:26.592 --> 00:13:29.194
Murray spirited him away at dawn.

00:13:29.228 --> 00:13:31.096
The prince also took your horse.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.566
He said he knew you wouldn't mind.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.148
In that case, Sassenach,

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:52.173
how long since you visited Inverness?

00:14:23.302 --> 00:14:25.370
Hold still.

00:14:25.373 --> 00:14:27.207
- Ah.
- Ah.

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.343
You big bairn.

00:14:29.377 --> 00:14:32.145
Angus'd rip that out
with his front teeth.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.615
He didn't have front teeth.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:37.150
He'd have used his gums then.

00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:39.219
Oh.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.055
I wish I could give you a tetanus shot.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.158
I'd take a shot at anything just now.

00:14:45.193 --> 00:14:47.728
Whiskey's the best I've got.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:48.929
Ah!

00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:52.399
Burghers!

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.111
- It was over there!
- To the south!

00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:57.704
Redcoats. Grab your arms!

00:14:57.739 --> 00:14:59.806
Grab your arms! Scatter to the woods!

00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:00.841
Wait!

00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:03.320
- There's no time. Go.
- Rupert!

00:15:03.344 --> 00:15:06.647
Rupert, you're with me! Go!

00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:07.892
Rupert, you're with me! Come on!

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:10.350
Meet at the crossroads.

00:15:13.254 --> 00:15:15.589
- Go.
- Go to the crossroads!

00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:18.292
Go!

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.198
Show her down!

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:26.700
Come on, Sassenach.

00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:50.424
I think we've lost them.

00:16:09.978 --> 00:16:13.847
- Rupert!
- Hurry up, damn you!

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.950
Hold on.

00:16:16.985 --> 00:16:19.786
Wait.

00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.888
Faster!

00:16:21.923 --> 00:16:24.091
Ride!

00:16:30.264 --> 00:16:31.398
Bloody!

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.836
I'm with ye, lad. I'm with you.

00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:56.023
Quick! Quickly!

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.335
They went this way! Come on!

00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:47.207
Are you sure it's wise for us to stop?

00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:50.777
If not, Claire assures
me Rupert will die.

00:17:53.081 --> 00:17:57.150
I haven't seen any
redcoats for some time.

00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:05.358
Wait for my signal.

00:18:26.214 --> 00:18:27.347
Sorry, Laird.

00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:28.749
I didna ken it was you.

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:30.250
It's fine.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.754
Where are your horses?

00:18:33.788 --> 00:18:36.389
Hidden in the woods beyond.

00:18:36.424 --> 00:18:37.891
Wallace is standing guard.

00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:39.236
We waited at the crossroads, but...

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.360
Aye, it's all right.

00:18:40.394 --> 00:18:42.729
Make sure ours are hidden as well.

00:18:42.764 --> 00:18:44.197
What happened to him?

00:18:44.232 --> 00:18:48.135
I decided to take a closer
look at a musket ball.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.137
Here, Fergus.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.339
Take out the whiskey and the bowl.

00:18:52.373 --> 00:18:56.309
Clear the altar and get him on it.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.410
Okay.

00:18:57.445 --> 00:18:59.212
I have to take out the bullet.

00:18:59.247 --> 00:19:01.748
It's a miracle it hasn't
shifted into your brain.

00:19:01.783 --> 00:19:04.451
It's a miracle they didna
shoot me in my good eye.

00:19:04.485 --> 00:19:05.886
Damn it, where's my knife?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.987
My lady.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.321
Well, where'd you get that?

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.723
Milord gave it to me.

00:19:09.757 --> 00:19:11.825
Well, give me the whiskey.

00:19:14.228 --> 00:19:15.662
Hold still.

00:19:39.086 --> 00:19:40.887
All right.

00:19:40.922 --> 00:19:43.990
Up you get.

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:48.028
Oh, well, I suppose one
eye is better than nane.

00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:50.964
Here, hold this.

00:19:50.998 --> 00:19:52.732
I'll get you a black eye patch.

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:55.735
You'll be like a proper pirate.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.805
Pirates have eye patches?

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.242
And peg legs and a parrot.

00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:04.354
What in the name of the wee
man are you heaving about?

00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:06.279
Mm, oh, never mind.

00:20:11.452 --> 00:20:13.787
Jamie.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.834
Blow out the candle.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:22.062
What is it?

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:26.700
What is that?

00:20:33.893 --> 00:20:35.194
You in the church!

00:20:35.228 --> 00:20:37.429
We have your men and your horses!

00:20:37.464 --> 00:20:41.300
I order you to surrender in
the name of His Majesty!

00:20:41.334 --> 00:20:42.868
- Redcoats?
- Aye.

00:20:42.902 --> 00:20:45.437
Oh, Christ.

00:20:58.918 --> 00:21:01.987
Lay down your arms and come out,

00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:04.923
or we shall fire the roof!

00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.258
There's not that many of them.

00:21:06.292 --> 00:21:07.826
We could stay and fight.

00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:11.029
No, they could fire the
thatch in seconds.

00:21:11.064 --> 00:21:13.265
Anyone not picked off
running out the door

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:15.934
will get burnt to death
when the roof caves in.

00:21:15.969 --> 00:21:16.935
He's right.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.738
We'll never make it.

00:21:19.773 --> 00:21:21.406
No.

00:21:21.441 --> 00:21:25.277
You have two minutes
to decide, gentlemen!

00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:27.980
I'm the one with a price on my head.

00:21:28.014 --> 00:21:29.915
Maybe I can bargain with them,

00:21:29.949 --> 00:21:31.817
give myself up in exchange
for your freedom.

00:21:31.851 --> 00:21:34.219
Och, stop being such a hero.

00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:36.021
If they take ye this time,

00:21:36.055 --> 00:21:38.123
it's a choice between the
hangman and the headsman.

00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:39.758
Better to stand and fight.

00:21:39.793 --> 00:21:41.504
Everyone here is
under my protection.

00:21:41.528 --> 00:21:44.196
If I can save you all
with my surrender...

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.497
- I'll do it.
- Wait.

00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:46.865
Perhaps there's another way.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.100
Och.

00:21:48.134 --> 00:21:49.311
No. There isn't, Claire,

00:21:49.335 --> 00:21:50.302
and we don't have time to...

00:21:50.336 --> 00:21:51.737
Help!

00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:53.238
Save me!

00:21:53.273 --> 00:21:55.184
Bloody hell, they've got
an Englishwoman in there.

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:56.942
Save me! I'm... I'm a British subject!

00:21:56.976 --> 00:21:58.177
Stop!

00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.278
Have you gone mad?

00:21:59.312 --> 00:22:01.780
Look, say I'm your hostage.

00:22:01.815 --> 00:22:04.516
They won't fire the
place with me inside.

00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.517
Exchange me.

00:22:05.552 --> 00:22:07.219
Use me to bargain with them.

00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:08.921
It worked the last time.

00:22:08.955 --> 00:22:10.355
With a lad.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.324
These are soldiers.

00:22:12.358 --> 00:22:13.992
No.

00:22:14.027 --> 00:22:15.093
Never.

00:22:15.128 --> 00:22:16.461
You in the church,

00:22:16.496 --> 00:22:19.064
if you have an Englishwoman in there,

00:22:19.098 --> 00:22:21.700
send her out now!

00:22:21.734 --> 00:22:23.135
Give up our hostage?

00:22:23.169 --> 00:22:26.872
Not likely. We'll rather...

00:22:26.906 --> 00:22:28.040
Claire's right.

00:22:28.074 --> 00:22:29.942
The soldiers will not hurt her.

00:22:29.976 --> 00:22:31.320
They'll escort her to a place
of safety, then let her go.

00:22:31.344 --> 00:22:32.444
I will not give you up!

00:22:32.478 --> 00:22:34.079
Bring out the woman,

00:22:34.113 --> 00:22:36.381
or we shall set fire to the thatch

00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:37.816
and burn you out!

00:22:37.851 --> 00:22:39.918
Yes, you will, you stubborn Scot.

00:22:39.953 --> 00:22:41.787
I will not.

00:22:41.821 --> 00:22:44.456
Am I not Lady Broch Tuarach?

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.393
Are these men not my responsibility too?

00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:11.617
You'll release the Englishwoman,

00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:15.187
surrender your horses and weapons.

00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:17.422
And you leave with the lady.

00:23:17.457 --> 00:23:19.524
I need your word of honor.

00:23:24.163 --> 00:23:27.299
Agreed. Your hostage, what is her name?

00:23:30.003 --> 00:23:32.404
Mistress Beauchamp is her name,

00:23:32.438 --> 00:23:35.007
a widow we encountered along the way.

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:36.475
We took her under our protection.

00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:38.377
Your protection?

00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:41.046
I know the reputation
of Highlanders, sir.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.148
I must tell you, if she has been harmed,

00:23:43.182 --> 00:23:45.183
all agreements are void.

00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:03.235
You're a bad liar, Sassenach.

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:05.203
Go out there wi' that look on your face,

00:24:05.238 --> 00:24:06.438
they'll ken something's amiss.

00:24:07.573 --> 00:24:11.510
Well, how am I supposed to look?

00:24:11.544 --> 00:24:13.679
I dinna ken.

00:24:13.713 --> 00:24:17.182
Less... guilty.

00:24:17.216 --> 00:24:20.485
Oh, perhaps you should faint, me lady.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.988
Mm, den they... they can't
ask you question right away.

00:24:23.022 --> 00:24:25.157
Off you go, son.

00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:26.201
They'll most likely take you

00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:28.093
to the garrison in Hazelmere.

00:24:28.127 --> 00:24:30.395
It's the nearest British
outpost in the area.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.097
They won't want a woman
weighing 'em down

00:24:32.131 --> 00:24:34.199
any more than is absolutely necessary,

00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:36.101
so come on.

00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:38.704
We'll make our way
there, fetch you back.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.707
All right.

00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:44.609
We need to leave.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.451
Wait.

00:24:52.485 --> 00:24:55.320
Now, you said it yerself.
You're a known man.

00:24:55.355 --> 00:24:57.155
If they recognize Red Jamie,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.326
they won't honor the bargain
they've struck, so...

00:25:01.361 --> 00:25:02.894
He's right.

00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:07.165
We will find each other.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.668
Trust in that.

00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:11.703
Come on.

00:25:28.215 --> 00:25:30.168
Behold the Jacobite army.

00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:31.851
That'll be enough, Lieutenant.

00:25:31.885 --> 00:25:33.519
Is she all right?

00:25:33.554 --> 00:25:34.687
She's fainted

00:25:34.722 --> 00:25:36.756
from terror.

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:40.476
I charge you personally

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.311
with the lady's protection,

00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:44.647
sir.

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:55.524
I urge you all, return to your homes!

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:59.428
Resume your lives as peaceful,
loyal subjects of the crown!

00:25:59.463 --> 00:26:00.930
Oh, aye.

00:26:00.964 --> 00:26:03.399
I'll be glad to,

00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:04.600
as soon as the true king

00:26:04.635 --> 00:26:07.470
is wearing that crown.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.915
Oh.

00:26:18.949 --> 00:26:19.916
Where am I?

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.751
You're safe, ma'am.

00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:23.786
You're under our protection now.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.788
That's a relief.

00:26:25.822 --> 00:26:27.590
Have you been harmed in any way?

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.965
No.

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:37.566
No, I'm quite all right.

00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:38.834
The lady says she's unharmed.

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:40.937
Yes, thank you, Lieutenant.

00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:43.072
Mount up!

00:26:45.742 --> 00:26:47.810
Thank you.

00:27:10.334 --> 00:27:12.768
Jamie.

00:27:12.803 --> 00:27:14.737
I'll look for a horse along the way.

00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:16.816
You and Murtagh gather the
rest of the men. Head north.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.407
Ye dinna need two to play shepherd.

00:27:18.442 --> 00:27:19.742
He's right. I'm coming with you.

00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:21.510
No.

00:27:21.545 --> 00:27:23.713
No, you'll both help me best
by seeing the men safe.

00:27:23.747 --> 00:27:25.815
I'll meet ye in Keswick,
once I've got Claire back.

00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:27.817
You can order them. Ye cannot order me.

00:27:27.851 --> 00:27:29.585
We'll go and find her together.

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:31.097
You'll need help getting
her out of the garrison.

00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:32.421
If it canna be me,

00:27:32.456 --> 00:27:34.757
Murtagh will do well enough.

00:27:34.791 --> 00:27:36.325
Godspeed, lad.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.328
Bring our lass back safe.

00:27:39.363 --> 00:27:40.563
Jamie.

00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:42.064
When you find her,

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:44.433
give her a wink for me, aye?

00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:53.342
<i>It didn't take long
to lose my sense of direction</i>

00:27:53.377 --> 00:27:56.012
<i>as we rode through the night.</i>

00:27:56.046 --> 00:27:58.381
<i>I knew I ought to be
leaving some sort of sign</i>

00:27:58.415 --> 00:28:00.016
<i>for him to follow,</i>

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.986
<i>but unfortunately, I was
short of bread crumbs.</i>

00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:06.088
We'll stop for the night in Crich, Mrs.
Beauchamp.

00:28:06.123 --> 00:28:08.924
The horses have gone as far as they can.

00:28:50.967 --> 00:28:52.768
Right outside.

00:29:07.451 --> 00:29:09.452
Mugs of beer all around,

00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:11.987
and your lady too.

00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:14.690
Hey, we'll need food as well.

00:29:14.724 --> 00:29:17.593
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

00:29:17.627 --> 00:29:19.628
Good, aye?

00:29:20.931 --> 00:29:22.965
Dispatch has just arrived for you, sir.

00:29:22.999 --> 00:29:24.900
Lieutenant.

00:29:29.573 --> 00:29:32.108
You look like you could
do with warming up.

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:51.727
Ma'am.

00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:53.362
It's time to go, madam.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.804
Where's the captain?

00:30:01.838 --> 00:30:04.340
He received orders to
proceed to Keswick,

00:30:04.374 --> 00:30:05.674
and he left during the night.

00:30:05.709 --> 00:30:07.376
Don't worry.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.488
Captain has said I was to
escort you to Bellmont

00:30:08.512 --> 00:30:10.880
before we rejoin him.

00:30:10.914 --> 00:30:13.816
Bellmont?

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.651
Bellmont?

00:30:15.685 --> 00:30:17.630
But I thought we were going
to the garrison at Hazelmere.

00:30:17.654 --> 00:30:19.388
Fortunes of war.

00:30:19.422 --> 00:30:21.000
Bellmont's closer and along
the road to Keswick.

00:30:21.024 --> 00:30:22.658
I wouldn't worry.

00:30:22.692 --> 00:30:24.527
It's a big house owned
by a rich Englishman.

00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:26.795
He'll give you refuge, I'm sure.

00:30:37.007 --> 00:30:38.607
Ah!

00:30:38.642 --> 00:30:40.843
Get away there.

00:30:43.146 --> 00:30:45.047
Lieutenant Barnes, really.

00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:46.582
I'm shocked that a king's officer

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:48.484
would behave in such
an unchristian manner.

00:30:48.518 --> 00:30:50.486
Ma'am, I thought he
meant to do you harm.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.555
Are you all right, sir?

00:30:52.589 --> 00:30:55.791
I apologize for the
lieutenant's beastly behavior.

00:30:55.825 --> 00:30:58.127
Here, let me help you up.

00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:02.665
Jamie's looking for me at Hazelmere.

00:31:02.699 --> 00:31:04.433
I still don't understand

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:05.945
why we're going to Bellmont
instead of Hazelmere.

00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:07.369
Captain's orders, ma'am,

00:31:07.404 --> 00:31:08.737
as I said.

00:31:08.772 --> 00:31:10.005
Very well, then.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.007
Bellmont it is.

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.589
Attention!

00:31:40.707 --> 00:31:41.787
Who did you say lives here?

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:43.909
Do I have the honor of addressing

00:31:43.943 --> 00:31:45.677
the Duke of Sandringham?

00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:52.317
You do, indeed.

00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:57.255
But the honor is all mine, Lieutenant.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.624
I do so treasure any opportunity

00:31:59.659 --> 00:32:01.927
to aid one of the king's officers,

00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:05.230
especially in these difficult times.

00:32:05.264 --> 00:32:06.865
How may I be of assistance to you?

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:10.602
This is for you, Your
Grace, from my commander.

00:32:10.636 --> 00:32:11.937
He requests your courtesy

00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:14.272
in giving temporary shelter to Mrs.
Beauchamp,

00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:17.709
an English gentlewoman
we rescued last night.

00:32:17.743 --> 00:32:19.711
Oh!

00:32:19.745 --> 00:32:22.347
My dear Mrs. Beauchamp,

00:32:22.381 --> 00:32:24.049
I should be delighted to offer you

00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:27.152
the hospitality of my humble home.

00:32:27.186 --> 00:32:28.653
I thank you, Your Grace.

00:32:28.688 --> 00:32:31.656
My commander will be most obliged.

00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:34.359
Good day, ma'am.

00:32:41.701 --> 00:32:43.668
I need a drink

00:32:43.703 --> 00:32:45.136
and something to eat,

00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:47.545
and so do you, from your appearance.

00:32:47.616 --> 00:32:48.582
Rescued, did he say?

00:32:48.617 --> 00:32:49.764
Rescued from what?

00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:51.277
Rabid bears?

00:32:51.417 --> 00:32:52.450
Highlanders.

00:32:52.475 --> 00:32:53.808
Much the same thing.

00:32:53.843 --> 00:32:56.244
Hmm.

00:32:56.278 --> 00:32:58.346
You mentioned a drink?

00:33:09.325 --> 00:33:10.325
I'll take the gray one.

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:12.227
You take the other.

00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:17.232
So, now we're traitors,
murderers, and horse thieves.

00:33:17.266 --> 00:33:18.933
Tell me, does it ever occur to you

00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:20.702
that taking Claire to wife

00:33:20.736 --> 00:33:23.772
might not ha' been the
wisest thing you ever did?

00:33:23.806 --> 00:33:26.174
- No.
- Hmm.

00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:27.542
It doesn't.

00:33:31.514 --> 00:33:33.815
And then they suddenly
changed their minds

00:33:33.849 --> 00:33:35.417
and brought me here.

00:33:39.155 --> 00:33:41.222
You have only the one
servant, Your Grace?

00:33:41.257 --> 00:33:44.192
Well, I do still have my valet.

00:33:44.226 --> 00:33:45.994
But, I'm afraid,

00:33:46.028 --> 00:33:49.831
things are a bit tight at the moment.

00:33:49.865 --> 00:33:54.002
The cook is only here three days a week.

00:33:54.036 --> 00:33:57.005
You've brightened my outlook
considerably by being here.

00:33:58.307 --> 00:34:01.276
Why did you pretend not to recognize me?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.078
It's not that I'm not grateful,

00:34:03.112 --> 00:34:06.047
but I was afraid you'd just
blurt out my real name.

00:34:06.082 --> 00:34:09.684
Oh, the last thing I would
do, my dear, is to blurt.

00:34:10.953 --> 00:34:13.154
But how could I possibly
commit such a lovely woman

00:34:13.189 --> 00:34:14.155
to the tower?

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.191
So damp.

00:34:16.226 --> 00:34:17.960
Quite took all the curls out of my wig

00:34:17.993 --> 00:34:19.828
the last time I was there.

00:34:19.862 --> 00:34:22.174
But I suppose you don't have to
suffer these inconveniences,

00:34:22.198 --> 00:34:24.065
do you?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.401
When were you a guest
at the Tower of London?

00:34:26.435 --> 00:34:28.436
And for what?

00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:31.706
Only a misunderstanding,
I can assure you.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.051
Don't suppose this misunderstanding

00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:35.944
had something to do with your loyalties.

00:34:35.978 --> 00:34:37.745
Quite.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.348
Which is why the army has
virtually made a ring

00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:43.351
around my estate.

00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.887
What, more soldiers than
there are out front?

00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:47.422
Oh, my, yes.

00:34:47.456 --> 00:34:49.434
They think they're being
inconspicuous, but really,

00:34:49.458 --> 00:34:52.026
with those coats?

00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:54.496
They claim that they're
resting and resupplying

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.297
before they move on.

00:34:56.332 --> 00:34:59.167
In fact, I'm being watched.

00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:04.806
Every entrance of this
house is being watched.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.976
I'm still suspected of being a Jacobite.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:12.113
I assume that your dashing husband

00:35:12.148 --> 00:35:16.317
must be intent on rescuing you

00:35:16.352 --> 00:35:19.387
even as we speak.

00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:22.190
It would be safe to assume so, yes.

00:35:22.224 --> 00:35:23.458
Excellent.

00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:25.393
Well, as I want to be rescued too,

00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:26.728
I'm coming with you.

00:35:26.762 --> 00:35:27.996
And that couldn't happen

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.997
if I had told the soldiers your name.

00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:30.832
I'm sorry.

00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:32.200
You're what?

00:35:32.234 --> 00:35:33.201
You must know.

00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:34.702
You've always known

00:35:34.737 --> 00:35:37.038
that in my heart I'm a Jacobite.

00:35:37.072 --> 00:35:39.340
I'm reasonably sure you
don't have a heart.

00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:41.943
Now, why would Jamie rescue you?

00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:43.411
Because I doubt that the dear lad

00:35:43.445 --> 00:35:46.314
knows where you actually are.

00:35:46.348 --> 00:35:47.949
How could he?

00:35:47.983 --> 00:35:49.494
The only way that he
could know your location

00:35:49.518 --> 00:35:52.253
is through my good offices.

00:35:52.288 --> 00:35:53.254
Really?

00:35:53.289 --> 00:35:55.256
Are you so sure about that?

00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:56.501
Perhaps he's riding
through the front gates

00:35:56.525 --> 00:35:58.226
in this very moment.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.996
Oh, I certainly hope he
isn't, because if so,

00:36:02.031 --> 00:36:05.967
he'll find himself in a trap.

00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:07.368
So what do you propose?

00:36:07.403 --> 00:36:11.806
I know a man who can get
notes past the soldiers.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.308
In return, though,

00:36:13.342 --> 00:36:16.211
I must have your word that
Jamie will extract me

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:18.146
from my present situation

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.150
and deposit me in some safe haven.

00:36:22.184 --> 00:36:27.088
I'm confident that Jamie will
honor his wife's promise.

00:36:27.122 --> 00:36:29.123
Fine.

00:36:29.158 --> 00:36:32.493
But I'll need some paper and a quill.

00:36:32.528 --> 00:36:35.463
Follow me.

00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:47.275
Gaelic?

00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:49.711
Do you speak that barbarous tongue?

00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:53.615
We both know that messages
are frequently intercepted.

00:36:53.649 --> 00:36:55.250
But if you don't trust me,

00:36:55.284 --> 00:36:56.494
I'm certainly happy to
write it in English

00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:58.052
and just hope that your messenger boy

00:36:58.087 --> 00:37:00.054
doesn't get caught.

00:37:00.089 --> 00:37:01.656
You wound me, madam.

00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:05.159
Your messenger is not to
go anywhere near Jamie.

00:37:05.194 --> 00:37:07.595
He is to deliver this to
a beggar named Munro,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.297
who can be found on the road

00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:11.666
somewhere between Crich and
the garrison at Hazelmere.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.234
If you get this message to him,

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:15.003
he will find Jamie.

00:37:16.605 --> 00:37:19.040
Claire!

00:37:19.074 --> 00:37:20.275
Mary.

00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:23.011
I knew I was forgetting something.

00:37:23.045 --> 00:37:25.179
Such a happy reunion.

00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:26.447
My lovely goddaughter has

00:37:26.482 --> 00:37:28.483
some exciting news of her own.

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:30.485
She's to be married.

00:37:30.519 --> 00:37:32.654
You're his goddaughter?

00:37:32.688 --> 00:37:35.923
Well, she's certainly
not a blood relative.

00:37:35.958 --> 00:37:39.227
I'm sure you two have a great
deal to say to each other.

00:37:39.261 --> 00:37:43.097
I have some correspondence to dispatch

00:37:43.132 --> 00:37:46.301
if you'll excuse me.

00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:51.673
Come with me.

00:37:59.715 --> 00:38:01.449
Mary, what are
we doing down here?

00:38:01.483 --> 00:38:03.051
This is the only place I can speak

00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:04.129
without feeling like
I'm being listened to

00:38:04.153 --> 00:38:06.187
or watched.

00:38:09.158 --> 00:38:10.201
Oh, Claire, you have to help me.

00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:11.192
I can't marry Mr. Granger.

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:12.193
I just can't.

00:38:12.227 --> 00:38:13.594
Who's Mr. Granger?

00:38:13.629 --> 00:38:15.263
The man my godfather's promised me to.

00:38:15.297 --> 00:38:17.165
A wealthy merchant who
wishes to attach himself

00:38:17.199 --> 00:38:20.068
to the family of a duke,

00:38:20.102 --> 00:38:23.638
even if it does mean
marrying soiled goods.

00:38:23.672 --> 00:38:25.907
A loyalist, I'll wager.

00:38:25.941 --> 00:38:27.175
Yes, I suppose so.

00:38:27.209 --> 00:38:28.242
Of course.

00:38:28.277 --> 00:38:29.977
Trying to play the British side

00:38:30.012 --> 00:38:31.690
by having his goddaughter marry
a supporter of the king.

00:38:31.714 --> 00:38:33.915
I don't care why. I just can't do it.

00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:35.283
Calm down.

00:38:35.317 --> 00:38:37.251
I will speak to your godfather.

00:38:37.286 --> 00:38:38.619
But he just made a decision

00:38:38.654 --> 00:38:40.688
that means you might not
have to marry a loyalist.

00:38:40.723 --> 00:38:42.123
Oh, would you?

00:38:42.157 --> 00:38:43.157
Thank you, Claire.

00:38:43.192 --> 00:38:46.661
Thank you so very much.

00:38:49.698 --> 00:38:51.499
Munro?

00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:53.601
Are you Munro?

00:38:53.635 --> 00:38:56.037
Good evening to you, sir.

00:38:56.071 --> 00:38:57.305
Good evening.

00:38:57.339 --> 00:38:59.173
I'm looking for a beggar called Munro.

00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:00.942
I understand he may be on this road.

00:39:00.976 --> 00:39:03.244
I'm not likely to be asking
the names of beggars.

00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:05.480
But have you seen any
beggars on this road?

00:39:05.514 --> 00:39:06.881
I passed an odd little fellow

00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:08.583
in a slouch hat and a raggedy coat

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:09.984
about half a mile back.

00:39:10.018 --> 00:39:11.586
Could have been a beggar.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.521
Much obliged.

00:39:25.334 --> 00:39:26.667
Hey!

00:39:26.702 --> 00:39:28.269
You there!

00:39:28.303 --> 00:39:32.306
Are you Munro?

00:39:32.341 --> 00:39:33.541
Wait! Wait!

00:39:33.575 --> 00:39:35.343
Munro!

00:39:35.377 --> 00:39:36.677
I'm looking for...

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.151
I've been sent by the
Duke of Sandringham

00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:45.486
to give you a letter.

00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:48.189
Ah.

00:39:48.223 --> 00:39:49.223
Oh.

00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:54.496
It was written by a
lady, Claire Beauchamp,

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.130
for a James Fraser.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.006
Customarily, I'd be given
a tip on delivery.

00:40:12.053 --> 00:40:13.740
Mrs. Beauchamp.

00:40:13.897 --> 00:40:15.798
Tired of Mary so soon?

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:17.209
Not that I blame you.

00:40:17.264 --> 00:40:18.708
Actually, I wanted to speak with you

00:40:18.742 --> 00:40:20.977
about your plans for her marriage.

00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:22.478
No discussion is necessary.

00:40:22.512 --> 00:40:25.915
The die is cast. The bargain is struck.

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:27.616
You'll be pleased to hear

00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:29.652
that I've been speaking
outside to the commander,

00:40:29.686 --> 00:40:32.488
who's agreed to withdraw the soldiers.

00:40:32.522 --> 00:40:34.957
But I thought they were
here keeping an eye on you.

00:40:34.992 --> 00:40:36.792
Well, they may not be very far away

00:40:36.827 --> 00:40:38.494
or for very long,

00:40:38.528 --> 00:40:40.496
but they will go.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.899
I mean, I am still a duke.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.718
Are you all right, madam?

00:41:02.753 --> 00:41:05.054
You seem perturbed in some way.

00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:09.025
How long has this man
been in your employ?

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:11.627
Well, I hired him in Paris.

00:41:11.661 --> 00:41:14.063
You're not thinking of stealing
him away for your husband.

00:41:14.097 --> 00:41:16.966
Danton is very loyal to me.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.902
When did you hire him in Paris?

00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:22.571
What an odd q...

00:41:25.075 --> 00:41:26.809
She recognizes you!

00:41:26.843 --> 00:41:29.412
Your Grace, I promise you
I took all precautions.

00:41:30.547 --> 00:41:31.914
You!

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:34.383
You put them up to it?

00:41:34.418 --> 00:41:35.918
Your own goddaughter?

00:41:35.952 --> 00:41:39.221
Yes, well, that was unfortunate.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.093
There was never any intent
that you should be killed,

00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:46.529
Mrs. Fraser.

00:41:46.563 --> 00:41:49.098
That was the comte's original desire,

00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:50.132
to be sure.

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.801
Comte?

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:53.536
The Comte St. Germain?

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.638
Yes. Ah...

00:41:55.672 --> 00:41:59.708
I understand that you
killed him yourself.

00:41:59.743 --> 00:42:03.145
I'd dearly love to have the
details of that encounter.

00:42:05.682 --> 00:42:08.884
I owed him a rather large
sum of money, you see,

00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:11.754
and I had no immediate means of payment,

00:42:11.788 --> 00:42:13.889
but I was horrified by the notion

00:42:13.924 --> 00:42:17.760
of disposing of such a delightful woman.

00:42:17.794 --> 00:42:20.029
Such a waste.

00:42:20.063 --> 00:42:24.467
So I managed to persuade
Monsieur le Comte

00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:26.669
that simply having you raped

00:42:26.703 --> 00:42:30.473
was sufficient revenge for
the loss of his goods.

00:42:30.507 --> 00:42:34.643
You should really be
very grateful to me.

00:42:35.979 --> 00:42:40.683
You could so easily be dead by now.

00:42:40.717 --> 00:42:44.487
And you still could be, madam,

00:42:44.521 --> 00:42:46.655
easily.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.191
No, you're going to regret
sending your guards away

00:42:49.226 --> 00:42:50.826
once Jamie gets here.

00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:52.795
I didn't send them very far away.

00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:56.999
When I told the captain that
I was expecting Red Jamie,

00:42:57.033 --> 00:43:00.536
he made himself a bit less conspicuous

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.572
to help lure your husband

00:43:03.607 --> 00:43:05.875
into my trap.

00:43:05.909 --> 00:43:07.676
Proving myself loyal to the crown

00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:09.445
by turning over Red Jamie

00:43:09.479 --> 00:43:12.781
and his traitorous English wife

00:43:12.816 --> 00:43:15.117
offers a much more permanent way

00:43:15.152 --> 00:43:19.054
of correcting misperception

00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:21.457
of my motives

00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:24.693
than going on the run.

00:43:27.731 --> 00:43:32.001
You could be hanged side by side.

00:43:32.035 --> 00:43:34.737
So romantic.

00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:45.014
Take Mrs. Fraser to her room.

00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:57.726
And lock her in.

00:44:21.751 --> 00:44:22.851
Hugh.

00:44:25.055 --> 00:44:27.423
Ho-ho.

00:44:27.457 --> 00:44:28.991
Oh.

00:44:29.025 --> 00:44:30.926
What the devil are you doing here?

00:44:33.597 --> 00:44:34.964
Eh-ah-way.

00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:38.534
Aye.

00:44:38.568 --> 00:44:40.169
- What's that now?
- I dunno.

00:44:40.203 --> 00:44:41.704
Says it's a letter from Claire.

00:44:44.507 --> 00:44:46.208
- He got it from a messenger.
- Ah.

00:44:46.243 --> 00:44:47.876
Is that supposed to be Gaelic?

00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:49.211
At least, it's trying to be.

00:44:49.246 --> 00:44:51.513
- What's that word?
- "Sighdran."

00:44:51.548 --> 00:44:53.249
That's not a word.

00:44:53.283 --> 00:44:54.750
She means soldiers.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.588
I think she means soldiers
around the house.

00:44:59.623 --> 00:45:01.890
The word order's all back to front.

00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:04.093
You can give her lessons later.

00:45:04.127 --> 00:45:05.861
"S."

00:45:05.895 --> 00:45:06.862
She's with Sandringham?

00:45:06.896 --> 00:45:07.963
Ah.

00:45:09.566 --> 00:45:10.843
That man's the original bad penny.

00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:12.001
Mm.

00:45:12.035 --> 00:45:13.636
You know where Bellmont House is?

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.571
Ha. Ah, ah-ooh-ooh.

00:45:15.605 --> 00:45:17.039
We go, huh?

00:45:17.073 --> 00:45:19.475
Aye.

00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:22.278
She's even misspelled "help."

00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:49.772
Hugh?

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.714
- Mary!
- What are you doing?

00:45:58.748 --> 00:46:00.049
Why are you locked in?

00:46:00.083 --> 00:46:01.394
I don't have time to
explain everything now.

00:46:01.418 --> 00:46:02.928
I have to get out of here
and get word to Jamie.

00:46:02.952 --> 00:46:04.353
Take me with you.

00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:06.955
All right, but you have to help me.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.324
I think Jamie is on his way,

00:46:08.358 --> 00:46:10.102
but there are soldiers
hiding in the grounds.

00:46:10.126 --> 00:46:11.137
I'll go out through the kitchen,

00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:12.361
you go out the front way.

00:46:12.395 --> 00:46:13.406
There's a beggar in the garden.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.396
A beggar?

00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:15.764
Yes, but he's a friend.

00:46:15.799 --> 00:46:16.765
His name is Hugh Munro.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.966
If you find him first,

00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:19.278
then you have to tell him to warn Jamie.

00:46:19.302 --> 00:46:20.736
It's a trap.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.148
He can't come anywhere near the house.

00:46:22.172 --> 00:46:24.173
Me, go out in the night
to meet a filthy beggar?

00:46:24.207 --> 00:46:25.251
Oh, Claire, I couldn't.
I couldn't possibly.

00:46:25.275 --> 00:46:27.409
For God sakes! Fine.

00:46:27.444 --> 00:46:30.746
Then stay here, but be quiet.

00:47:23.933 --> 00:47:26.668
Good evening, my dear.

00:47:26.703 --> 00:47:29.004
Do forgive the informality.

00:47:29.038 --> 00:47:32.841
I wasn't expecting a guest.

00:47:32.876 --> 00:47:35.444
Nothing worse than going to
bed on an empty stomach,

00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:38.046
don't you agree?

00:47:40.116 --> 00:47:41.216
Do join me.

00:47:59.837 --> 00:48:02.265
Did you truly strike down the comte

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.057
in front of the king himself,

00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:06.827
or was it at the king's order?

00:48:08.429 --> 00:48:10.097
It was an accident.

00:48:10.131 --> 00:48:12.232
I doubt that.

00:48:12.266 --> 00:48:14.501
The Comte is a most distasteful man.

00:48:14.535 --> 00:48:18.105
No sense of humor whatever.

00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:24.811
Perhaps I shall have something to eat.

00:48:24.846 --> 00:48:27.247
It's going to be a very long night.

00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:30.317
The time will move swiftly with
such a charming companion.

00:48:31.986 --> 00:48:36.223
One rumor was that you
cast a spell on the Comte

00:48:36.257 --> 00:48:39.259
and that his heart just stopped.

00:48:41.863 --> 00:48:45.999
What the devil are you doing here?

00:48:46.033 --> 00:48:49.236
Uh... uh... I just
wanted something to eat.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.114
Just go to bed.

00:49:01.149 --> 00:49:03.016
Now.

00:49:04.552 --> 00:49:06.153
Lady Broch Tuarach and I

00:49:06.187 --> 00:49:09.556
are having a most amusing conversation.

00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:37.461
Claire's downstairs in the kitchen.

00:49:37.485 --> 00:49:38.685
Tell Jamie it's a trap.

00:49:38.719 --> 00:49:41.521
Where are you going, little mouse?

00:49:41.556 --> 00:49:44.424
Ah!

00:49:46.727 --> 00:49:48.395
Ah, let go of me, you brute,

00:49:48.429 --> 00:49:50.730
or I'll tell my godfather
how you grabbed me.

00:50:04.645 --> 00:50:06.746
Stand and watch, Hugh.

00:50:32.807 --> 00:50:34.407
My personal favorite

00:50:34.442 --> 00:50:36.576
has you turning a broomstick
into a poisonous serpent

00:50:36.611 --> 00:50:39.613
and commanding it to attack the comte,

00:50:39.647 --> 00:50:41.258
sort of like a latter-day
Pharaoh and Moses...

00:50:41.282 --> 00:50:42.716
Lady Moses, I mean.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:46.519
Your Grace, I found Mademoiselle
out on the front steps.

00:50:46.554 --> 00:50:48.054
I can't marry Mr. Granger.

00:50:48.089 --> 00:50:49.422
I... I tried to run away,

00:50:49.457 --> 00:50:51.191
but it was so dark, and I was so scared,

00:50:51.225 --> 00:50:52.626
and I was afraid of the soldiers.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.561
- And I just couldn't...
- For God sake!

00:50:54.595 --> 00:50:57.063
Just go to bed!

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.300
Now, where was I?

00:51:00.334 --> 00:51:02.235
Um, oh, yes, the snake story.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.703
Well, now... good Lord.

00:51:03.738 --> 00:51:06.373
Claire!

00:51:09.343 --> 00:51:12.312
Throw your weapon away and back off!

00:51:30.698 --> 00:51:32.699
This is the man who
attacked us in Paris!

00:51:34.335 --> 00:51:36.069
Claire.

00:51:36.103 --> 00:51:37.381
Now, now, now, now, now come on.

00:51:37.405 --> 00:51:39.272
Le-let's all just calm down

00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:40.707
and discuss this thing rationally

00:51:40.741 --> 00:51:42.609
like level-headed people.

00:51:42.643 --> 00:51:44.110
It wasn't my fault.

00:51:44.145 --> 00:51:44.872
He made me do it.

00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:45.932
It's true.

00:51:45.967 --> 00:51:47.300
He arranged the attack

00:51:47.335 --> 00:51:50.170
to pay off one of his debts to St.
Germain.

00:51:52.073 --> 00:51:53.406
Y-y-y...

00:51:53.441 --> 00:51:56.109
I-I-it could have been so
much worse, believe me.

00:51:56.144 --> 00:51:58.345
You can't imagine what
the comte had in mind.

00:51:58.379 --> 00:52:00.614
I just told Danton to terrify the women.

00:52:00.648 --> 00:52:02.482
You know me, Jamie.

00:52:02.517 --> 00:52:05.952
I'd never countenance such
a vulgar thing as a rape.

00:52:05.987 --> 00:52:08.421
That's a lie.

00:52:08.456 --> 00:52:10.524
Rape was your idea.

00:52:10.558 --> 00:52:12.325
Aye, aye, I do know you, Your Grace.

00:52:14.195 --> 00:52:16.429
You'll say whatever to whoever
to save your own skin.

00:52:16.464 --> 00:52:18.165
Well, that stops today.

00:52:18.199 --> 00:52:19.800
Now, I... I swear it.

00:52:19.834 --> 00:52:20.867
I promise.

00:52:23.905 --> 00:52:26.173
Aye, as you say.

00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:42.989
Mary!

00:53:28.583 --> 00:53:31.618
I kept my word.

00:53:31.732 --> 00:53:35.134
I lay your vengeance at your feet.

00:53:43.918 --> 00:53:46.019
I think we'd better go.

00:54:00.825 --> 00:54:03.945
