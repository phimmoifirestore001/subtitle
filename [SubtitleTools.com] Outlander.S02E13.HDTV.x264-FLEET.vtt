00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:05.597
Previously...

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:08.024
My pain, it grows more tedious.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.252
It will be like drifting
off into a deep sleep.

00:00:11.427 --> 00:00:12.428
Oh, brother.

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:14.746
The prince is a canny, slippery man.

00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:16.379
We have thwarted him all we can.

00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:19.840
All that plotting. How the
bloody hell did we end up here?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.310
The prince will have his
battle on Culloden Moor.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.570
It is the promise of history.

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:27.380
Promise me that if the time should come,
you will go back through the stones.

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:28.840
I promise.

00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:31.384
- Claire?
- Frank, I'm back.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.119
I'm carrying another man's child.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.522
- Yes, Roger?
- May I go outside to play, Father?

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:38.657
I don't think I've ever
heard him call you father.

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:42.127
Children accept the world
as it is presented to them.

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:43.228
I want us to be together.

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:44.568
Are you sure about this, Frank?

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.888
We will raise this child as our own.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.347
Yours and mine.

00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:10.372
_

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:20.166
Good morning, Mrs. Peel.

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.295
Good morning, Steed. The door's open.

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:30.375
Social visit?

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:33.626
That's it. Happened to be passing
by, thought I'd drop in.

00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:39.613
The coffee's over there.

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:45.942
Not enough flexibility in the wrist.

00:02:47.757 --> 00:02:50.460
Weight on the wrong foot.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:51.775
Friendly advice.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:55.479
There doesn't appear to be any cream.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.815
The cream... is in the kitchen.

00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:00.350
Oh.

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:05.788
You really should get
back to your guests.

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:07.389
They keep asking for you.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.009
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.779
It would've meant a great
deal to my father.

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:39.284
And if you knew him, you know that he was
not one to leave anything to chance,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.286
including the toast for his own wake.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.593
"To Death, the jolly old bouncer now."

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:55.564
"Our glasses let's be clinking. If
he hadn't put other out, I trow,

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:56.905
to-night we'd not be drinking."

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.574
- The Reverend.
- The Reverend.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.616
Your father was such a delightful man.

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:16.779
I'll always remember his sense of humor.

00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:17.589
Thank you.

00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:19.720
The Reverend helped so many people.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.423
- He'll be sorely missed.
- Thank you.

00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.458
Would you excuse me, uh, for a moment?

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:26.727
Oh, of course.

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:29.462
Roger, so sorry to hear about your loss.

00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:31.697
- Thanks very much.
- It's nice to see you.

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:33.699
- My condolences.
- Thanks very much.

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:35.568
Appreciate it.

00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.436
- You have my sympathies.
- Oh, thank you.

00:04:37.536 --> 00:04:39.337
I'll speak to you in a minute.

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:41.339
- Tom, how are you?
- Yeah, not bad.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.917
- Good.
- Listen, Roger, I'll be here for you.

00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.743
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Okay.

00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:50.119
Are you Roger Wakefield?

00:04:52.037 --> 00:04:54.505
Yes.

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:58.755
Definitely. That's me. Yes.

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:01.924
- I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure.
- Roger.

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.501
It is.

00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:05.261
Well, I can't believe it.

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.588
After all these years.

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.865
Uh, I'm sorry,

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:11.733
but do I... do I know you?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.537
Oh, of course, you wouldn't remember me.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.757
Last time I saw you, you were about,
oh, seven or eight years old.

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:22.066
I'm Claire Randall. I was an
old friend of your father's.

00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:22.733
Ah.

00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:24.630
Very sorry to hear about his passing.

00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:27.881
- Thank you.
- I see you've met my daughter.

00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:31.518
Actually, no, we haven't
been formally introduced.

00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:33.418
Brianna.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.887
The daughter.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.341
A pleasure, Miss Randall.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.410
We were staying with relatives
down in London when we heard.

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.370
His heart, I believe?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.964
Yes, yes, uh... very sudden.

00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:52.602
I'd just seen him at Christmas,
and he was in high spirits.

00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:57.687
I hadn't seen your father in a very long
time, but I... I was very fond of him.

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:02.545
- So was Daddy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:07.541
Uh, my late husband, Frank...
they were very close.

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:09.818
Randall.

00:06:09.862 --> 00:06:13.755
Frank Randall, of course.
I remember you now, yes.

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:18.726
Claire. You... you're
a nurse, as I recall.

00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:23.830
Oh, yes, I was. I... I'm a doctor now.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.166
She's being modest. She's a surgeon.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:28.901
Hm.

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.838
Uh, Bree and I are... are
visiting from the States.

00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:34.740
Oh, I thought I detected
an American accent.

00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:38.744
- Boston, to be exact.
- She's a history major in Harvard.

00:06:38.844 --> 00:06:42.447
Really? I'm on leave from the
history department at Oxford.

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:45.716
Oxford. Impressive.

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:48.986
Is Mrs. Graham still in
the Reverend's employ?

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:50.921
I haven't seen her yet.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.690
Sadly, we lost her a few years ago,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.993
but her granddaughter
Fiona is here somewhere.

00:07:00.563 --> 00:07:06.500
So many things are the same, and
yet things are so different.

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:10.838
There are quite a lot of memories here.

00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:12.173
Would you excuse me?

00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:15.743
- I'd like to take a look around.
- Yeah.

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:32.792
- Uh, first time in Scotland, then?
- Uh-huh.

00:07:32.892 --> 00:07:36.896
And will you have much time to take
in the sights while you're here?

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:40.865
We only came up for the day so
Mother could pay her respects.

00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:43.045
We're meant to be headed
back to London this evening.

00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:47.038
Oh, that's a shame.
Beautiful, wild country.

00:07:47.137 --> 00:07:49.607
I was always curious about Scotland.

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:52.242
It was a special place
to both my parents.

00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:53.543
Roger?

00:07:53.643 --> 00:07:58.546
I beg your pardon, but
it's time to say good-bye.

00:07:58.648 --> 00:08:00.783
The Browns are leaving.

00:08:00.883 --> 00:08:04.120
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, Fiona.

00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:10.926
Uh... you'll excuse me for a moment?

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:12.559
Yeah.

00:08:33.369 --> 00:08:37.749
Mrs. Graham had warned me not to
spend my days chasing a ghost,

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:39.817
and so I hadn't.

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:44.621
But now that I was here, the
ghosts were starting to chase me.

00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:56.832
Thanks again.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:58.968
Thank you. Arthur, love to your wife.

00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:01.003
Hey, sorry she couldn't come along.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:03.673
Well, we should be going.

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:05.340
Not all the way back to London?

00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:09.343
Oh, no, we'll drive as far as we can
and then stop at a pub for the night.

00:09:09.443 --> 00:09:11.784
There's plenty of room here
if you'd like to stay.

00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:15.582
Oh, we couldn't possibly impose.

00:09:15.683 --> 00:09:17.350
You wouldn't be.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.770
In fact, I'd welcome the company.

00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:20.620
It's a big house.

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:23.002
Sounds better than jolting down
the wrong side of the road

00:09:23.089 --> 00:09:25.357
in the dark.

00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:28.895
Besides, it'll give me a
chance to take in the sights.

00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:31.764
I hear it's a beautiful, wild country.

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.967
All right.

00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:40.154
- Uh, just so long as we're no bother.
- I'll fetch your bags from the car.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:42.810
- The guest room's just...
- Top of the stairs.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.675
I remember.

00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:11.633
I couldn't sleep, so I
helped myself to a dram.

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:12.834
I hope you don't mind.

00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:15.669
Oh, no bother.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.738
I'll have one with you.

00:10:32.517 --> 00:10:33.886
Ah.

00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.820
That's better.

00:10:43.027 --> 00:10:45.662
You know, I pestered him for
years to throw things away

00:10:45.763 --> 00:10:48.031
and clean up the clutter.

00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:50.200
Now I can't bear to part with any of it.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.802
There's a lot of history here.

00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:52.902
Mm-hmm.

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:54.136
Not just the family's, either,

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:57.740
but Scotland's as well.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.284
The college here in
Inverness have asked me

00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:02.878
to donate his library to their archives.

00:11:02.978 --> 00:11:05.180
I'm not sure I'll donate everything.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.682
He was quite fond of
several rare editions

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:10.851
of Prince Charles Stuart and
the Battle of Culloden.

00:11:12.953 --> 00:11:14.088
Culloden.

00:11:14.188 --> 00:11:15.823
Mm.

00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:19.692
Final battle of the '45.

00:11:19.793 --> 00:11:24.097
My ancestors fought and
died there, actually.

00:11:24.197 --> 00:11:25.231
Really?

00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:29.267
Yes, my true name's Roger MacKenzie.

00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:32.871
My parents were Jerry
and Marjorie MacKenzie.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.008
The Reverend adopted me

00:11:36.108 --> 00:11:38.042
after they were killed in World War II.

00:11:40.144 --> 00:11:43.014
MacKenzie.

00:11:43.114 --> 00:11:46.249
I used to know quite a few MacKenzies...

00:11:46.349 --> 00:11:48.718
once upon a time.

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:50.486
It's a common name here.

00:11:54.858 --> 00:11:57.860
May I ask you something personal?

00:12:02.364 --> 00:12:03.765
How did you do it?

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:13.073
Finally say good-bye...

00:12:13.173 --> 00:12:16.944
to that one person you loved
most in all the world?

00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:28.787
Truth is, I've never been
very good at saying good-bye,

00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:31.022
but that's the hell of it, isn't it?

00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:37.062
Whether you want to say good-bye or not,

00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:41.932
they're gone, and...

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:44.134
you have to go on living without them.

00:12:52.008 --> 00:12:54.177
Because that's what they would want.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.326
Thank you for the whisky.

00:13:12.426 --> 00:13:13.827
Good night, Roger.

00:13:47.457 --> 00:13:51.061
God, you are so like him.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.050
I tell you, the... the army is not ready

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.851
for battle this day.

00:14:17.952 --> 00:14:19.192
We must retreat to safer ground

00:14:19.252 --> 00:14:20.987
before the British
realize their advantage

00:14:21.087 --> 00:14:22.155
and destroy us all.

00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:31.863
You are my Thomas.

00:14:31.964 --> 00:14:34.132
It was the Apostle Thomas who doubted

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.168
the Lord who had risen from the dead...

00:14:40.037 --> 00:14:41.973
Not until he felt the wounds,

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:45.076
pressed his fingers where
the nails had been.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:46.376
The Lord said to him,

00:14:46.476 --> 00:14:49.879
"Because you have seen, you believe,

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.557
"but blessed are those who have not seen

00:14:51.581 --> 00:14:53.016
and yet believe."

00:14:57.086 --> 00:14:59.354
But today is the day, James.

00:14:59.454 --> 00:15:02.057
And mark me, before this day is over,

00:15:02.157 --> 00:15:04.492
I will make a believer of you.

00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:15.402
It's a blessing...

00:15:15.502 --> 00:15:18.938
Colum didn't live to see this dark day.

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:21.274
It's the prince.

00:15:21.374 --> 00:15:24.076
The Battle of Culloden
will happen today,

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:25.344
just as history foretold.

00:15:25.444 --> 00:15:27.113
Sentries have spotted the advance guard

00:15:27.213 --> 00:15:28.347
four miles out.

00:15:28.447 --> 00:15:30.249
Cumberland has broken camp.

00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:32.050
His army is marching on the south side

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.451
of Kildrummie Moss.

00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:35.086
Go inside.

00:15:35.186 --> 00:15:37.488
Inform Lord George.

00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:40.290
There's only one thing left.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.926
One possibility.

00:15:43.027 --> 00:15:44.061
What's that?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.064
Not here.

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:23.029
Fort William.

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:25.197
Built in the 1600s.

00:16:25.297 --> 00:16:28.400
The Gaelic name for it
is An Gearastan Dubh,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.136
"The Black Garrison."

00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:34.472
It was used by the British as
a command post and prison,

00:16:34.572 --> 00:16:36.740
intended to control the "savage clans

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.976
and the roving barbarians."

00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:43.413
Military history isn't
really my specialty.

00:16:43.513 --> 00:16:46.216
It was your father's, though, right?

00:16:46.316 --> 00:16:49.486
The Reverend has a couple of
his books in the library.

00:16:51.853 --> 00:16:55.091
One of my earliest memories
is dropping an ice cream cone

00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.326
off the ramparts of Fort Ticonderoga,

00:16:57.426 --> 00:17:00.129
while he held forth on the
heroics of Ethan Allen

00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:02.130
and the Green Mountain Boys.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.165
Ethan Allen?

00:17:04.265 --> 00:17:06.534
"I regret I have but
one life to give..."

00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:08.536
Nathan Hale.

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:11.538
Common mistake.

00:17:11.638 --> 00:17:16.009
Never quote American
history to an American.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.177
The Revolutionary War

00:17:17.277 --> 00:17:20.012
is practically a religious
text in Boston.

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:22.148
With George Washington as the Messiah

00:17:22.248 --> 00:17:25.551
and, uh, Benedict Arnold
as Judas, no doubt.

00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:28.553
Benedict Arnold is a deeply
misunderstood historical figure.

00:17:28.653 --> 00:17:32.056
I thought you didn't
like military history.

00:17:32.157 --> 00:17:36.361
We Randalls are a verra
complicated clan, laddie.

00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:38.429
That is absolutely

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:41.498
the worst accent I have ever heard.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.440
Do you remember my father very well?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.576
Bits and pieces.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:57.146
He was a snappy dresser.

00:17:57.246 --> 00:18:00.182
Wore his hat down over
one eye, very dashing,

00:18:00.282 --> 00:18:02.284
and, um...

00:18:02.384 --> 00:18:04.185
seemed very kind.

00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:05.819
He was.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:09.089
The kindest man in the world.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.092
Your mother seems very kind as well.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.462
My mother...

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:18.465
lives in another world.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.568
This place gives me the chills.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.303
With good reason.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:27.639
Many Scottish prisoners
were flogged here.

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.841
A lot of blood was
spilled on this ground.

00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:40.504
My father built this place, ye ken.

00:19:40.604 --> 00:19:44.607
His blood and sweat are in this stone.

00:19:44.707 --> 00:19:46.676
Are you playing with the apples?

00:19:46.776 --> 00:19:48.578
What's your name?

00:19:48.678 --> 00:19:50.313
This is my wee Jamie.

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:51.523
This is your uncle, mo chridhe,

00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:54.383
the one you're named after.

00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:56.252
Congratulations,

00:19:56.352 --> 00:19:57.686
your bonny little lass...

00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:01.556
Little Margaret Ellen Murray.

00:20:01.656 --> 00:20:03.224
'Twas my grandmother's name.

00:20:03.324 --> 00:20:05.593
Claire, Claire, they're ready.

00:20:05.693 --> 00:20:08.363
- They're giant.
- Oh, my goodness.

00:20:08.463 --> 00:20:10.630
You were right, telling
us to plant them.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.732
I'm beginning to feel like...

00:20:12.832 --> 00:20:15.435
I actually belong here.

00:20:15.535 --> 00:20:17.804
I knew ye belonged here with me,

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:20.373
since the first time I laid eyes on ye.

00:20:23.809 --> 00:20:26.445
"Come and let us live, my Dear.

00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:29.347
Let us love and never fear."

00:20:29.447 --> 00:20:32.584
"Then let amorous kisses dwell,

00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:35.587
"on our lips, begin and tell

00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:38.822
"a Thousand and a Hundred score,

00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:43.460
a Hundred and a Thousand more."

00:21:18.558 --> 00:21:20.627
This battle, this war...

00:21:20.727 --> 00:21:22.628
everything that's about to happen...

00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:25.331
it all depends on Charles.

00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:26.498
Aye.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.735
And what if he were to die...

00:21:30.835 --> 00:21:32.770
now?

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.472
Right now.

00:21:34.572 --> 00:21:35.849
Then the battle wouldn't happen,

00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:38.543
and this whole bloody
rebellion would die with him.

00:21:41.978 --> 00:21:43.813
Christ.

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:46.783
I have this.

00:21:46.883 --> 00:21:49.251
It's yellow jasmine, and it's poisonous.

00:21:49.352 --> 00:21:50.786
It's what Colum took last night.

00:21:50.886 --> 00:21:52.821
Colum?

00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:54.590
He begged me.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.359
He knew that his time was near.

00:21:56.459 --> 00:21:57.659
He took his own life?

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.394
Claire, that's a mortal sin.

00:21:59.494 --> 00:22:02.430
He wanted a quick and peaceful death,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.699
and I gave it to him.

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:06.733
Charles has been suffering
with scurvy for weeks,

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:09.302
and I've been treating him
regularly with tinctures.

00:22:09.403 --> 00:22:10.671
I could put this in a tea.

00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:16.342
Kill Charles Stuart?

00:22:24.716 --> 00:22:27.419
The way it works...

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:29.488
it would be like drifting
into a deep sleep.

00:22:33.391 --> 00:22:35.693
And he would never know?

00:22:35.793 --> 00:22:37.728
No one would ever know.

00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:47.804
Do you have any memory of
an incident that happened

00:22:47.904 --> 00:22:50.707
with my parents when they were here?

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:52.374
How do you mean, "incident"?

00:22:52.474 --> 00:22:53.885
Something big that happened between them

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:55.744
when they were here
staying with your father.

00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:58.313
I was just a wee lad.

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:05.019
I don't remember all the details, but...

00:23:07.422 --> 00:23:09.856
I do recall finding Mrs. Graham crying

00:23:09.956 --> 00:23:12.358
out in the tool shed.

00:23:12.459 --> 00:23:15.595
There were a lot of broken
things lying about,

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:18.731
and I think she said your
father had lost his temper

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:19.871
and smashed everything up.

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.898
My father smashed...

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.701
Yes, but that wasn't the reason

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:23.702
why she was crying,

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.337
I'm certain of that.

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:27.605
My father definitely had a temper,

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:30.442
but he kept it tightly under wraps.

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.709
When did this happen?

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:33.511
What year?

00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:35.713
Your mother said I was seven or eight

00:23:35.812 --> 00:23:38.549
when she last saw me,
so it must have been...

00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:40.951
1947 or '48.

00:23:51.594 --> 00:23:54.496
My father kept this...

00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:57.866
lockbox on the top shelf of his closet.

00:24:00.635 --> 00:24:01.712
I knew where he hid the key,

00:24:01.736 --> 00:24:04.505
so one day,

00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:06.440
I opened it.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.709
There were letters in
there from your father.

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:12.612
Mostly academic stuff, but...

00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:14.714
there was this one letter.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.786
The Reverend mentioned an incident

00:24:19.886 --> 00:24:22.387
involving my mother and my father,

00:24:22.488 --> 00:24:23.922
and the way he phrased it

00:24:24.022 --> 00:24:26.525
made me feel like it was something big,

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.759
maybe something terrible.

00:24:27.859 --> 00:24:29.394
Definitely something he didn't want

00:24:29.495 --> 00:24:32.563
to spell out on paper.

00:24:32.663 --> 00:24:35.533
It scared me for some reason.

00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:38.469
I put the letter back
in the box, locked it,

00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:40.970
and never looked at it again.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.476
My father kept a journal.

00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:48.677
He wrote in it every night after supper.

00:24:48.777 --> 00:24:50.579
There's boxes of them
in the storage room,

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:52.715
if you wouldn't mind
getting a bit grubby.

00:24:52.815 --> 00:24:53.982
Grubby doesn't bother me.

00:24:54.082 --> 00:24:55.518
You should see my bedroom.

00:24:56.984 --> 00:24:58.419
That didn't come out right.

00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:02.557
No, no, but I... I, uh,

00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:03.825
I get your meaning.

00:26:04.712 --> 00:26:06.747
So I've traced the chain of title

00:26:06.847 --> 00:26:10.650
for the estate known as
Lallybroch or Broch Tuarach

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.719
and found this.

00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:15.722
It's the earliest document
we have in our files,

00:26:15.822 --> 00:26:18.757
a deed of sasine, transferring
title to the property

00:26:18.857 --> 00:26:22.961
from James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser

00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:25.931
to James Jacob Fraser Murray.

00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:30.501
The property was transferred
in 1745, witnessed

00:26:30.602 --> 00:26:33.037
by Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser

00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:35.906
and Claire Beauchamp...

00:26:36.006 --> 00:26:37.674
well, it's a bit smudged, but I think

00:26:37.774 --> 00:26:39.610
her surname's Fraser as well.

00:26:43.847 --> 00:26:45.648
Yes...

00:26:47.817 --> 00:26:50.519
I believe it was.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.088
And, uh, after that?

00:26:53.188 --> 00:26:54.856
Various Murrays, it seems.

00:26:54.956 --> 00:26:56.658
The property stayed in that family

00:26:56.758 --> 00:26:58.660
for many generations.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.762
I've, uh, made you a copy,

00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:02.630
so this one is yours to keep.

00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:06.634
Thank you.

00:27:06.734 --> 00:27:08.268
One last thing.

00:27:08.368 --> 00:27:10.871
Is it possible to do a
genealogical search?

00:27:10.971 --> 00:27:12.939
Aye, what's the name?

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:14.573
Roger MacKenzie.

00:27:18.077 --> 00:27:19.812
How was your date?

00:27:19.912 --> 00:27:22.313
It wasn't a date.

00:27:22.413 --> 00:27:23.682
Well, you have to admit

00:27:23.782 --> 00:27:27.552
he is rather handsome and intelligent.

00:27:27.653 --> 00:27:29.820
Not to mention, he has
a lovely physique.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.756
Who says "physique"?

00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:34.625
Stop.

00:27:34.725 --> 00:27:37.561
Of course, there are
those deep blue eyes.

00:27:37.662 --> 00:27:38.561
Maybe you should date him.

00:27:38.662 --> 00:27:39.662
Hmm.

00:27:39.696 --> 00:27:41.698
So where did you end up going?

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.099
Fort William.

00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:46.169
Have you been?

00:27:48.136 --> 00:27:50.105
Once.

00:27:50.205 --> 00:27:55.010
Didn't much care for the place.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.579
So what did you do today?

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.115
I just puttered around the village.

00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:03.985
Places you and Daddy went before?

00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:05.719
Some.

00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:12.959
Do you miss him?

00:28:16.095 --> 00:28:17.629
Of course.

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:22.768
Sometimes it doesn't seem like you do,

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.168
or...

00:28:24.268 --> 00:28:26.070
you ever loved him.

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:32.976
What a thing to say.

00:28:33.076 --> 00:28:34.978
Well, did you?

00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:36.146
Love him?

00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:40.684
I did.

00:28:56.798 --> 00:28:59.867
Make no mistake, this would be

00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:01.969
cold-blooded murder

00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:02.970
you would be carrying out.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.139
To stop a slaughter.

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:07.775
If we kill the prince, we take one life

00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:09.175
to save thousands.

00:29:09.275 --> 00:29:11.711
Jamie.

00:29:11.811 --> 00:29:13.856
Lord George requests yer
presence near the east dyke.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.081
Ye've to come at once.

00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:16.850
They're calling the men to form lines.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.050
Aye, on my way.

00:29:22.187 --> 00:29:24.689
We would need to move quickly.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.058
I could put this in his tea
now and give it to him.

00:29:28.292 --> 00:29:30.061
Ye ungrateful son-of-a-bastard.

00:29:34.098 --> 00:29:36.199
You filthy, whoring witch.

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:49.444
I'm meeting the curator
on the second floor.

00:29:49.544 --> 00:29:51.947
I shouldn't be long, then we, uh,

00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:53.714
can go start the great excavation

00:29:53.815 --> 00:29:56.851
of the Reverend's journals.
Will you be okay?

00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:00.822
- Yeah, sure, I'll hang out.
- Okay.

00:30:23.108 --> 00:30:25.243
And we can no longer allow

00:30:25.343 --> 00:30:27.979
their vision to dictate ours.

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:29.980
When Scotland was united with England

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.281
under a single crown,

00:30:31.381 --> 00:30:33.918
it was the beginning of the end for us.

00:30:34.018 --> 00:30:37.187
We lost more than our independence.

00:30:37.287 --> 00:30:41.224
We lost our spirit.

00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:43.827
The government in Westminster,

00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:45.161
the bankers in the city,

00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:47.863
the newspapers of Fleet Street

00:30:47.963 --> 00:30:50.265
have stolen our money.

00:30:51.934 --> 00:30:54.302
Our voices...

00:30:54.402 --> 00:30:56.170
our futures.

00:31:00.107 --> 00:31:03.110
Where are the rulers of old

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.146
who knew how to look after their people?

00:31:08.214 --> 00:31:11.151
The kings who have become legendary...

00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:13.119
Arthur of Wales,

00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:15.855
Richard the Lionheart,

00:31:15.955 --> 00:31:18.123
Prince Charles Edward Stuart...

00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:21.927
Our Bonnie Prince?

00:31:22.027 --> 00:31:25.163
We've all heard of the
Battle of Culloden...

00:31:27.966 --> 00:31:30.334
But imagine how different

00:31:30.434 --> 00:31:33.003
Scotland would be now

00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:36.006
if we had won.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.411
Where is our Bonnie
Prince Charlie today?

00:31:47.917 --> 00:31:50.418
I am...

00:31:50.518 --> 00:31:52.187
Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:31:52.287 --> 00:31:53.454
Yes.

00:31:53.554 --> 00:31:56.191
You are Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:57.825
Yes.

00:31:57.926 --> 00:32:01.195
We are Bonnie Prince Charlie.

00:32:01.295 --> 00:32:03.297
Aye. Scotland!

00:32:14.107 --> 00:32:15.384
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

00:32:15.408 --> 00:32:17.175
Cheers, and take that.

00:32:17.275 --> 00:32:18.275
Yes, thanks.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.811
I liked your speech,

00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:22.380
but wasn't it the Scottish king James VI

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.116
who united the crowns?

00:32:24.216 --> 00:32:26.283
And Queen Anne, his
Scottish granddaughter,

00:32:26.383 --> 00:32:28.319
who signed the Acts of Union?

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:29.419
Aye,

00:32:29.453 --> 00:32:31.822
but Anne was raised Anglican,

00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:34.857
already under the
influence of Westminster.

00:32:34.958 --> 00:32:37.260
Prince Charles and his father King James

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.895
wanted to undo all that.

00:32:38.995 --> 00:32:40.239
Sounds like they would've been just

00:32:40.263 --> 00:32:41.898
trading one king for another.

00:32:41.998 --> 00:32:44.066
Charles was Catholic and a Scot.

00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:46.368
Unlike German Geordie and the Hanovers,

00:32:46.468 --> 00:32:49.071
his loyalty was to us.

00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:51.106
Maybe.

00:32:51.206 --> 00:32:52.974
You're an American.

00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:54.375
Are you a student here?

00:32:54.475 --> 00:32:55.876
Brianna Randall.

00:32:55.977 --> 00:32:57.378
Just visiting.

00:32:57.478 --> 00:33:00.414
So why are you here?

00:33:00.514 --> 00:33:02.015
I'm a history student.

00:33:02.115 --> 00:33:04.084
I like watching history being made.

00:33:04.184 --> 00:33:06.954
There you are.

00:33:07.054 --> 00:33:09.189
Roger Wakefield.

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:10.557
Gillian Edgars.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.563
There's another big
rally later, near here.

00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:23.134
We'll be making history.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:25.937
Cheers.

00:33:42.518 --> 00:33:46.455
Tall fellow, wasn't he?

00:33:46.555 --> 00:33:50.192
Wasn't that tall in real life.

00:33:50.292 --> 00:33:52.294
He could have been great.

00:33:52.394 --> 00:33:54.429
He had the name, the cause,

00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:55.963
the support of good men

00:33:56.063 --> 00:34:00.067
willing to lay down their lives for him.

00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:02.036
They've taken a fool,

00:34:02.136 --> 00:34:04.271
turned him into a hero.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.445
And what's that thing inside there?

00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:14.980
Hmm, not sure.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.017
Looks like a dragonfly, maybe?

00:34:30.494 --> 00:34:33.296
Dougal. It's not what ye think, man.

00:34:33.396 --> 00:34:34.497
No?

00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:36.933
Not what I think?

00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:38.068
What, that, uh,

00:34:38.168 --> 00:34:41.470
that woman was urging ye to foul murder,

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.105
the murder of your prince.

00:34:43.205 --> 00:34:44.582
- No.
- Dougal, you have to listen...

00:34:44.606 --> 00:34:48.277
Shut your mouth.

00:34:48.377 --> 00:34:49.478
I kent you were a traitor

00:34:49.578 --> 00:34:51.146
the first time I clapped eyes on ye.

00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:53.214
Easy now.

00:34:54.682 --> 00:34:58.486
Ye see, Jamie...

00:34:58.585 --> 00:35:02.156
ye place yer trust in someone, ye know?

00:35:02.256 --> 00:35:05.425
And ye... ye give into them...

00:35:05.525 --> 00:35:08.427
ye give into them with
your heart and your soul,

00:35:08.527 --> 00:35:11.030
and for you to then plan the murder

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.331
of our beloved prince...

00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:14.500
- No, Dougal...
- Christ.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.001
Christ.

00:35:18.336 --> 00:35:20.105
I'd rather be hung,
drawn, and quartered.

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:22.074
I would.

00:35:22.174 --> 00:35:24.242
Oh, Jamie.

00:35:24.342 --> 00:35:26.243
Ye've just... ye've
betrayed us, you know?

00:35:26.343 --> 00:35:29.180
Ye have. All of us.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.182
Your people.

00:35:31.282 --> 00:35:33.150
And worse than that,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.530
ye've betrayed Scotland herself.

00:35:34.617 --> 00:35:36.419
No.

00:35:36.519 --> 00:35:39.155
And you. You're nothing

00:35:39.255 --> 00:35:40.556
but a lying slut,

00:35:40.656 --> 00:35:43.359
who would lead a man by
the cock to his doom,

00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:46.128
with your claws sunk
deep into his balls.

00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:47.929
Claire is my wife.

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:51.032
Ye'll no speak ill of
her, even in your anger.

00:35:51.133 --> 00:35:52.201
Anger?

00:35:54.602 --> 00:35:56.270
Anger?

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.271
Oh, no.

00:35:57.371 --> 00:35:59.273
What ye've done to me...

00:35:59.373 --> 00:36:00.374
we're past anger.

00:36:00.474 --> 00:36:02.142
You're tired, Dougal.

00:36:02.242 --> 00:36:04.144
Cold and hungry.

00:36:04.244 --> 00:36:05.244
Leave now.

00:36:06.246 --> 00:36:07.246
No!

00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:13.552
Claire.

00:36:13.652 --> 00:36:15.421
Jamie, come to me

00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:17.389
and I'll kill you quick
for your mother's sake.

00:36:17.489 --> 00:36:19.158
Dougal, we can talk this through.

00:36:54.489 --> 00:36:55.389
Just stay down.

00:36:55.489 --> 00:36:56.557
Just stay.

00:37:58.213 --> 00:38:00.247
I'm so sorry, Uncle.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.126
How long since anyone's
been in this place?

00:38:14.227 --> 00:38:15.428
Ages, I expect.

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.366
Are these his journals?

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.337
Aye.

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.405
Aye, if there's anything
here about what happened

00:38:28.505 --> 00:38:30.341
back in 1948,

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.343
we should be able to find it.

00:38:34.777 --> 00:38:36.646
What was that?

00:38:36.746 --> 00:38:38.514
Probably a rat.

00:38:38.614 --> 00:38:41.551
Here, use that.

00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.353
At least you won't be taken by surprise.

00:38:44.453 --> 00:38:46.355
Too late for that.

00:38:46.455 --> 00:38:48.723
Would you rather I did a rat satire?

00:38:48.823 --> 00:38:50.191
A what?

00:38:51.293 --> 00:38:53.561
A rat satire.

00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:55.563
An old Scottish custom.

00:38:55.663 --> 00:38:57.465
If you had rats in your house,

00:38:57.565 --> 00:38:59.367
you could make them go
away by singing to them

00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:01.200
and telling them how poor the eating was

00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:03.670
where they were and how
good it was elsewhere.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.738
You're kidding, right?

00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:17.716
Dinna stay and gnaw my wellies.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.420
You just made that up.

00:39:23.488 --> 00:39:25.256
Obviously.

00:39:25.356 --> 00:39:29.426
Any good rat satire must always be...

00:39:29.526 --> 00:39:31.595
original.

00:39:31.695 --> 00:39:33.730
Wow, after that performance,

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.232
there shouldn't be a rat
within miles of this place.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.739
Randall.

00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:52.547
Now there's an heirloom for you.

00:39:52.647 --> 00:39:54.382
A letter of commission in the army,

00:39:54.482 --> 00:39:56.350
signed by His Royal Majesty,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.319
King George II.

00:39:58.419 --> 00:40:00.754
Dated 1735.

00:40:02.656 --> 00:40:04.790
"Jonathan Wolverton Randall."

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.293
I remember Daddy talking about him.

00:40:07.393 --> 00:40:08.561
He's one of our ancestors.

00:40:16.735 --> 00:40:18.470
Here's a letter from your father.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.575
The Reverend was doing
research on the Captain...

00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:27.478
and my father told him
to abandon the project.

00:40:27.578 --> 00:40:29.713
"He's not the man I thought."

00:40:29.813 --> 00:40:31.348
Odd.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.453
Then let's take these
boxes into the library.

00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:39.822
Oh, God.

00:40:39.922 --> 00:40:40.922
Oh, Christ.

00:40:40.989 --> 00:40:42.391
Rupert.

00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:43.859
I'd have torn out my one good eye,

00:40:43.959 --> 00:40:45.794
if it could have stopped me seeing this.

00:40:45.894 --> 00:40:47.496
But seen it I have.

00:40:47.596 --> 00:40:49.530
Aye, ye have.

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:52.500
Wait.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.301
There's one service I ask of you.

00:40:57.772 --> 00:41:00.340
Give me two hours.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.676
There are some things I need to tend to.

00:41:02.776 --> 00:41:03.810
Ye understand?

00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:09.281
And then?

00:41:09.382 --> 00:41:12.851
And then I'll come back and
answer for what I have done.

00:41:12.951 --> 00:41:14.820
I give ye my word.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.621
Two hours.

00:41:16.721 --> 00:41:17.855
Grant me that,

00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:20.758
before ye speak.

00:41:20.858 --> 00:41:22.727
For the memory of the friendship

00:41:22.827 --> 00:41:25.429
that I once had for you,

00:41:25.529 --> 00:41:27.398
which you have now murdered

00:41:27.498 --> 00:41:30.867
as certainly as you did my chieftain...

00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:33.804
I'll give ye two hours,

00:41:33.903 --> 00:41:37.339
and then I'll damn your
soul to the fiery pit.

00:41:51.486 --> 00:41:54.855
You can see how flat and
open and boggy it is.

00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:56.857
The Highland army was
completely exposed,

00:41:56.957 --> 00:42:00.461
and they then charged into
the teeth of musket fire,

00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:01.994
cannons, mortars.

00:42:02.094 --> 00:42:03.930
And it was very, very quick

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.498
and very bloody.

00:42:05.598 --> 00:42:06.933
In effect,

00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:09.868
Culloden marked the end of the clans

00:42:09.968 --> 00:42:12.504
and the end of the
Highlander way of life.

00:42:22.447 --> 00:42:24.482
Are you a Fraser?

00:42:27.784 --> 00:42:29.385
Yes.

00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:30.720
I am.

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.908
I swore I'd never set foot

00:42:54.008 --> 00:42:56.843
on this horrid place,

00:42:56.943 --> 00:42:59.746
but here I am...

00:42:59.846 --> 00:43:02.382
and you're here too.

00:43:02.483 --> 00:43:04.049
Or your bones, at least.

00:43:06.952 --> 00:43:09.054
I'm not going to cry...

00:43:10.723 --> 00:43:13.458
Because you wouldn't want that,

00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:15.694
and besides...

00:43:18.897 --> 00:43:20.899
I've come with good news.

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:28.872
You have a daughter, Brianna.

00:43:31.073 --> 00:43:34.544
Named after your father,

00:43:34.644 --> 00:43:36.913
just as I promised.

00:43:46.054 --> 00:43:48.689
Jamie, I...

00:43:48.789 --> 00:43:52.527
was angry at you...

00:43:52.627 --> 00:43:54.695
for such a long time.

00:43:58.665 --> 00:44:01.935
You made me go and live a life that...

00:44:02.035 --> 00:44:04.137
I didn't want to live.

00:44:05.805 --> 00:44:07.873
But you were right,

00:44:07.973 --> 00:44:09.875
damn you.

00:44:12.778 --> 00:44:17.649
Brianna was safe...

00:44:17.749 --> 00:44:19.617
and loved...

00:44:19.717 --> 00:44:21.853
and raised well.

00:44:21.953 --> 00:44:24.555
But sometimes,

00:44:24.655 --> 00:44:26.857
oh, when she turns and the light

00:44:26.957 --> 00:44:29.593
catches her red hair or...

00:44:31.662 --> 00:44:33.996
I see her smile in her sleep...

00:44:35.831 --> 00:44:37.833
It takes my breath away...

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.737
Because I see you.

00:44:47.909 --> 00:44:50.144
She was born...

00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:52.012
7:15

00:44:52.112 --> 00:44:55.148
on a rainy Boston morning.

00:44:59.887 --> 00:45:00.887
And that's everything.

00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:06.593
Everything I can remember.

00:45:06.693 --> 00:45:09.095
See? No tears.

00:45:09.195 --> 00:45:11.663
Bet you didn't think I
could do that, did you?

00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:26.677
That day at Craigh na Dun...

00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:31.681
We said a lot of things,

00:45:31.781 --> 00:45:36.652
but there was one thing I didn't say.

00:45:36.752 --> 00:45:37.786
Couldn't.

00:45:41.156 --> 00:45:43.091
I haven't for...

00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:44.727
20 years.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.834
But I'm here,

00:45:52.934 --> 00:45:54.567
and now it's time.

00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:06.646
Good-bye, Jamie Fraser.

00:46:09.782 --> 00:46:11.016
My love.

00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:29.700
Rest easy, soldier.

00:46:52.987 --> 00:46:56.757
"Kidnapped by the Fairies"?

00:46:56.857 --> 00:46:57.924
"Claire Randall,

00:46:58.024 --> 00:47:00.727
"wife of noted historian
Frank Randall...

00:47:00.827 --> 00:47:03.129
"Holiday in Inverness. Car found.

00:47:03.229 --> 00:47:05.865
Police thought she was
possibly murdered."

00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:07.275
Well, obviously not. She turned up.

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:08.901
Three years later.

00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:10.201
"Mysteriously found wandering,

00:47:10.235 --> 00:47:13.038
dressed in rags,
disoriented, incoherent."

00:47:13.138 --> 00:47:16.941
I think we've found your "incident."

00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:18.943
What about the Reverend's journal?

00:47:19.043 --> 00:47:20.845
Maybe he says more about this.

00:47:20.945 --> 00:47:23.114
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:47:23.214 --> 00:47:24.848
You may not like what you find.

00:47:24.948 --> 00:47:28.018
I want the truth.

00:47:28.118 --> 00:47:31.722
No matter what.

00:47:37.259 --> 00:47:38.660
Oh, there you are.

00:47:38.761 --> 00:47:40.763
Would you like some tea?

00:47:40.863 --> 00:47:42.263
What I'd like is to know

00:47:42.363 --> 00:47:45.233
exactly what you've been
doing the past two days.

00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:47.035
As I told you, I've just been...

00:47:47.135 --> 00:47:49.237
Puttering around town, collecting herbs.

00:47:49.337 --> 00:47:50.939
Is that all?

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.742
What's going on, Bree?

00:47:54.842 --> 00:47:56.910
Did you see him?

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.178
Who?

00:47:58.278 --> 00:48:00.813
My father.

00:48:00.913 --> 00:48:02.749
Did you see my father?

00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:04.329
What kind of question is that to ask?

00:48:04.383 --> 00:48:05.752
Not Daddy.

00:48:05.852 --> 00:48:07.186
No, he's dead. I know that.

00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:08.888
I'm talking about my father,

00:48:08.988 --> 00:48:11.122
the man you had an affair with.

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:13.759
The man you were with for three years.

00:48:35.044 --> 00:48:36.211
Bree.

00:48:42.818 --> 00:48:45.020
It's complicated.

00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:47.688
No, it's pretty simple, actually.

00:48:47.789 --> 00:48:49.991
Newspapers say your "miraculous return"

00:48:50.091 --> 00:48:52.093
was in April 1948.

00:48:52.193 --> 00:48:56.162
I was born in November '48.

00:48:56.262 --> 00:48:57.764
I did the math, and it turns out

00:48:57.864 --> 00:48:59.332
you were three months pregnant

00:48:59.432 --> 00:49:02.836
when the fairies brought
you back to Daddy.

00:49:04.303 --> 00:49:06.271
Bree...

00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:09.108
I found something else in the
Reverend's correspondence.

00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:11.110
Not sure what it means, but...

00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:17.248
Oh.

00:49:17.348 --> 00:49:18.883
I'm sorry. I should let you...

00:49:18.983 --> 00:49:20.251
No, stay.

00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:22.285
It's your house,

00:49:22.385 --> 00:49:24.822
and you haven't lied to anyone.

00:49:28.926 --> 00:49:30.827
I think we should talk alone.

00:49:30.927 --> 00:49:33.429
He's my friend, and he stays.

00:49:38.234 --> 00:49:40.201
All right.

00:49:42.203 --> 00:49:44.172
But I think you should sit down.

00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:03.256
Yes.

00:50:03.356 --> 00:50:05.291
There was a... another man.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.997
And I loved him very much.

00:50:17.001 --> 00:50:20.371
And yes...

00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:22.406
he was your real father.

00:50:27.177 --> 00:50:30.413
You lied.

00:50:30.513 --> 00:50:33.815
All my life, you've lied to me.

00:50:33.916 --> 00:50:35.951
Frank didn't want you to know.

00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:39.221
Don't you dare blame this on him.

00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:42.190
He wanted to raise you as his own,

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.859
and I agreed.

00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:49.230
It's why we moved to America.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.098
So we could put all this behind us.

00:50:51.198 --> 00:50:53.967
Until you found an excuse
to visit Scotland?

00:50:56.403 --> 00:50:58.471
Is that really why we're here?

00:50:58.571 --> 00:51:00.106
So I could have some kind of

00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:02.975
surprise introduction to my real father?

00:51:03.075 --> 00:51:04.310
No.

00:51:08.947 --> 00:51:11.816
It's not possible, anyway.

00:51:11.917 --> 00:51:15.020
Because he has no interest
in meeting his daughter?

00:51:18.222 --> 00:51:20.157
Because he's dead.

00:51:20.257 --> 00:51:25.162
I promised Frank I wouldn't
tell you about him,

00:51:25.262 --> 00:51:29.198
so for 20 years, I...

00:51:29.298 --> 00:51:32.235
I haven't uttered his name out loud.

00:51:35.338 --> 00:51:39.174
But now you know,

00:51:39.274 --> 00:51:41.343
and I need to tell you about him.

00:51:46.313 --> 00:51:47.848
About your real father...

00:51:51.185 --> 00:51:52.286
Jamie Fraser.

00:51:55.321 --> 00:51:58.458
I don't want to know anything about him.

00:51:58.558 --> 00:52:01.094
Not one single thing.

00:52:02.162 --> 00:52:04.129
Bree. Brianna.

00:52:04.229 --> 00:52:07.899
You told me you just wanted
the truth, no matter what.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.301
This is it.

00:52:26.183 --> 00:52:30.219
Most important...

00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:33.055
Jamie loved you

00:52:33.155 --> 00:52:35.291
very much.

00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:38.294
Even though he never met you,

00:52:38.394 --> 00:52:41.963
he loved you with all his heart.

00:52:42.063 --> 00:52:44.499
And he would have raised you...

00:52:50.104 --> 00:52:51.438
Well, if it wasn't...

00:52:57.243 --> 00:52:59.345
If it wasn't...

00:52:59.445 --> 00:53:02.281
for the Battle of Culloden.

00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:04.317
I've killed Dougal MacKenzie.

00:53:06.684 --> 00:53:08.186
Huh.

00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:10.388
Canna say I'm that surprised,

00:53:10.488 --> 00:53:12.557
only that it took ye so long.

00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:14.059
What's to do, then?

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:27.103
What is it?

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:29.039
A deed of sasine.

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.416
It conveys the title of Lallybroch

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.208
to James Jacob Fraser Murray.

00:53:32.308 --> 00:53:33.618
Giving the place over to your nephew.

00:53:33.642 --> 00:53:34.543
Aye.

00:53:34.643 --> 00:53:36.178
This protects Lallybroch

00:53:36.278 --> 00:53:37.555
and keeps the estate in the family,

00:53:37.579 --> 00:53:39.081
safe from the Crown,

00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:40.525
to be held in trust by Jenny and Ian

00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:42.483
until Wee Jamie is old enough.

00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:44.118
But it's dated from a year ago.

00:53:44.218 --> 00:53:47.488
Aye, before the rebellion, before...

00:53:47.588 --> 00:53:49.390
I was a traitor.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.458
I just need the signature
of two witnesses.

00:53:51.558 --> 00:53:53.493
Go fetch your master
ink and a quill, lad.

00:53:53.593 --> 00:53:55.195
Quick about it. Go.

00:53:57.697 --> 00:53:59.232
Will ye have me take it to Jenny?

00:53:59.332 --> 00:54:01.533
No, I'll have Fergus take it.

00:54:01.633 --> 00:54:03.469
- Me, milord?
- Aye.

00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:06.338
Aye, you're to ride to Lallybroch.

00:54:06.438 --> 00:54:07.673
Ye'll leave now.

00:54:11.209 --> 00:54:13.511
This must reach Madame
Murray without fail.

00:54:13.611 --> 00:54:17.082
It is worth more than my life or yours.

00:54:17.182 --> 00:54:19.183
I don't want to leave you, milord.

00:54:19.283 --> 00:54:21.518
- I refuse.
- Ye must.

00:54:21.618 --> 00:54:23.538
Not just for the deed, but
no matter what happens

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.123
here today, it's important
someone remembers.

00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:30.426
You understand?

00:54:30.526 --> 00:54:33.028
I will not fail you, milord.

00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:35.030
I know ye won't.

00:54:43.205 --> 00:54:44.205
So how long have you been

00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:48.008
cooking up this story?

00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:52.279
No, I... I know this
must sound crazy, but...

00:54:52.379 --> 00:54:55.181
Did you really think I
would swallow this...

00:54:55.281 --> 00:54:57.117
fairy tale?

00:54:57.217 --> 00:55:01.121
Do you think I'm still five years old?

00:55:01.221 --> 00:55:03.222
It is not a fairy tale, Bree.

00:55:03.322 --> 00:55:06.391
The man I grew up with, who
loved me for 20 years,

00:55:06.491 --> 00:55:08.059
isn't my father.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.394
My real father

00:55:09.494 --> 00:55:12.263
is some 6'3" redheaded guy in a kilt

00:55:12.363 --> 00:55:15.633
from the 18th century?
What is wrong with you?

00:55:15.733 --> 00:55:18.702
Listen to me. Frank was your father

00:55:18.802 --> 00:55:21.704
in every way that matters

00:55:21.804 --> 00:55:25.542
except one.

00:55:25.642 --> 00:55:29.146
He didn't make you.

00:55:29.246 --> 00:55:32.581
Jamie and I did.

00:55:32.681 --> 00:55:35.317
You're just like him.

00:55:35.417 --> 00:55:39.187
Your hair, your mannerisms.

00:55:39.287 --> 00:55:41.189
Oh, he would have loved
you and raised you if...

00:55:41.289 --> 00:55:44.159
If it hadn't been for
the Battle of Culloden?

00:55:44.259 --> 00:55:45.593
Oh, my God, stop.

00:55:45.693 --> 00:55:47.128
It's true.

00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:48.395
Here.

00:55:48.495 --> 00:55:51.431
Look at this.

00:55:51.531 --> 00:55:53.467
Here.

00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:56.236
The deed to Lallybroch.

00:55:56.335 --> 00:55:57.736
Claire Beauchamp Fraser.

00:55:57.836 --> 00:55:59.472
It... it's my maiden name, my signature.

00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:00.739
Just admit it!

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:04.343
Admit that you are not a perfect person.

00:56:04.443 --> 00:56:06.678
Own up to the fact that
you fucked someone else

00:56:06.778 --> 00:56:08.213
while you were married to Daddy,

00:56:08.313 --> 00:56:10.182
just like a million
other bored housewives.

00:56:10.282 --> 00:56:12.384
I was not bored, and
what Jamie and I had

00:56:12.484 --> 00:56:14.318
was a hell of a lot more than fucking.

00:56:14.418 --> 00:56:17.254
He was the love of my life!

00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:25.661
Why are you doing this?

00:56:29.232 --> 00:56:31.501
Bree, I...

00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:34.436
I'm doing this

00:56:34.536 --> 00:56:36.538
because it's the truth.

00:56:39.674 --> 00:56:43.644
Only two people know what
the truth really is,

00:56:43.744 --> 00:56:45.646
and one of them is dead.

00:56:48.882 --> 00:56:51.218
Too bad it wasn't you.

00:57:06.898 --> 00:57:10.701
You stop for nothing, except to sleep.

00:57:10.801 --> 00:57:13.371
And if you do, hide yourself well.

00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:20.444
You're a soldier now,

00:57:20.544 --> 00:57:21.645
mon fils.

00:57:21.745 --> 00:57:23.413
I love you like a son.

00:57:27.316 --> 00:57:29.318
Like our own son.

00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:04.316
That doesn't mean anything.

00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:06.351
I don't know what it
means, to be honest,

00:58:06.451 --> 00:58:08.563
but the Reverend obviously
thought it meant something.

00:58:08.587 --> 00:58:10.255
She's insane.

00:58:10.355 --> 00:58:11.789
That's all that matters.

00:58:11.889 --> 00:58:14.458
Now, don't lash out at me,

00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:19.196
but that deed of sasine
did look authentic.

00:58:19.297 --> 00:58:23.333
So some woman back in 17-whatever

00:58:23.433 --> 00:58:25.268
had the same name as she does,

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.569
or she read about someone

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.405
and is fantasizing it was her own life.

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:31.340
Or what if there's...

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.409
something to her story?

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:35.744
Keep that up and I might just
lash out at you after all.

00:58:35.844 --> 00:58:37.713
Now, look, you told me

00:58:37.813 --> 00:58:40.281
that you could never get
close to your mother,

00:58:40.381 --> 00:58:41.716
that she lived in another world.

00:58:41.816 --> 00:58:45.353
Well, maybe she's trying
to show you that world.

00:58:45.453 --> 00:58:46.754
So you believe she traveled

00:58:46.854 --> 00:58:50.624
200 years into the past?

00:58:50.724 --> 00:58:51.825
Through a stone?

00:58:51.925 --> 00:58:54.461
It's not important if I believe it.

00:58:54.561 --> 00:58:58.297
She believes it.

00:58:58.397 --> 00:59:00.533
I'm just saying,

00:59:00.633 --> 00:59:02.868
maybe we should keep an open mind.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.538
How 'bout we keep an open tab instead?

00:59:27.923 --> 00:59:30.393
There were ghosts around me everywhere

00:59:30.493 --> 00:59:31.894
since I'd arrived.

00:59:31.993 --> 00:59:34.529
The face was unmistakable:

00:59:34.629 --> 00:59:36.531
Geillis Duncan.

00:59:36.631 --> 00:59:39.501
I remembered the date she'd
told me at the trial,

00:59:39.601 --> 00:59:42.269
the year she came through the stones.

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.505
1968.

00:59:44.605 --> 00:59:46.574
This was no ghost.

00:59:46.674 --> 00:59:48.308
Geillis was here...

00:59:48.409 --> 00:59:50.443
a younger version of her...

00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:51.778
but she was here.

01:00:31.714 --> 01:00:32.715
Hello, uh...

01:00:32.815 --> 01:00:35.483
I'm looking for Gillian Edgars.

01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:36.918
Is this her residence?

01:00:37.018 --> 01:00:38.920
Aye.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.622
And what is it you want with her?

01:00:40.722 --> 01:00:42.724
Well, I'm an old friend of Gillian's,

01:00:42.824 --> 01:00:44.491
Claire Randall.

01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:45.726
You must be...

01:00:45.826 --> 01:00:47.594
Greg.

01:00:47.694 --> 01:00:48.862
Her husband.

01:01:01.906 --> 01:01:03.975
I'm not going to be in the area long.

01:01:04.075 --> 01:01:05.810
Do you know where she might be?

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.746
I'd love to say hello.

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:09.614
Aye.

01:01:09.714 --> 01:01:12.516
She will likely be with
the Roses, but I...

01:01:12.616 --> 01:01:13.917
I've no kept up.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.721
SlÃ inte.

01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:21.958
The Roses?

01:01:22.058 --> 01:01:23.726
The White Roses of Scotland?

01:01:23.826 --> 01:01:26.663
Aye.

01:01:26.763 --> 01:01:30.766
Aye, bloody Nationalists.

01:01:30.866 --> 01:01:32.501
She spends all her time

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:35.504
down the Institute, day and night,

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:38.739
spendin' all my money on courses.

01:01:38.839 --> 01:01:41.008
Folklore, they call it.

01:01:42.843 --> 01:01:46.514
She filled up a million
notebooks with her findings.

01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:49.449
Why not just learn to type?

01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:51.451
Get a job if she's bored...

01:01:51.551 --> 01:01:54.921
that's what I told her.

01:01:55.021 --> 01:01:56.655
So she left.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.691
It's been weeks now.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.938
So you say she's been gone for weeks?

01:02:15.038 --> 01:02:16.540
Aye.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.510
That's what I said.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.912
Like...

01:02:22.012 --> 01:02:23.813
if ye do see Gilly,

01:02:23.913 --> 01:02:26.716
tell her to come home, eh?

01:02:26.816 --> 01:02:27.850
Tell her I love her.

01:02:29.985 --> 01:02:31.554
Of course.

01:02:59.978 --> 01:03:03.114
Honestly, this pub's been
here since 1820, and...

01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.916
Gillian, hi.

01:03:05.016 --> 01:03:07.018
You missed a great rally earlier.

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:08.719
I'm sorry we missed it.

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:10.521
Roger and I are just having a whisky.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:14.525
Aye. It's been a bit of a tricky day.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:15.625
My mother's insane.

01:03:15.693 --> 01:03:16.593
Mm.

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:17.594
A sentiment echoed

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.028
by daughters everywhere.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:22.732
Maybe I'll catch you
again at the next rally.

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:27.536
Afraid I'm leaving tonight to...

01:03:27.636 --> 01:03:29.572
further the cause.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:32.007
But don't stop asking
the hard questions.

01:03:32.107 --> 01:03:35.677
That's the way the world changes.

01:03:41.248 --> 01:03:44.618
For hours I read Geillis' notebooks.

01:03:44.718 --> 01:03:47.954
I tried to make sense of
the convoluted pages.

01:03:48.054 --> 01:03:50.891
They contained formulas
about the art and science

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:53.025
of time travel.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:56.028
Unlike myself, Geillis had studied

01:03:56.128 --> 01:03:58.598
and prepared for her journey.

01:03:58.698 --> 01:04:00.766
I was stunned to learn she believed

01:04:00.866 --> 01:04:02.166
you must have a human sacrifice

01:04:02.266 --> 01:04:04.035
to move through the stones,

01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:07.939
and gemstones to protect and guide you.

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:09.641
From what I could tell,

01:04:09.741 --> 01:04:11.975
Geillis planned to pass
through Craigh na Dun,

01:04:12.075 --> 01:04:13.677
and soon.

01:04:13.777 --> 01:04:17.047
Sadly, I knew how that trip would end:

01:04:17.147 --> 01:04:20.783
with Geillis burned on
a pyre in Cranesmuir.

01:04:20.883 --> 01:04:22.819
I had to try and stop her.

01:04:29.224 --> 01:04:31.827
Gather the Frasers of
Lallybroch together

01:04:31.927 --> 01:04:33.061
and get them out of here.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:34.796
There'll be pell-mell on the moor,

01:04:34.896 --> 01:04:38.666
wi' troops and horses moving to and fro.

01:04:38.766 --> 01:04:41.669
Nobody will try and stop you
wi' the British in sight

01:04:41.769 --> 01:04:43.604
and the battle about to begin.

01:04:43.704 --> 01:04:46.073
Tell them the order comes from me,

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:47.941
and they'll follow without question.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.109
Lead them off the moor and
away from the battle.

01:04:50.209 --> 01:04:52.078
Set them on the road to Lallybroch

01:04:52.178 --> 01:04:53.780
and home.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.181
Are ye sure?

01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:58.150
Aye.

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.953
This battle is already lost.

01:05:01.053 --> 01:05:02.721
No matter how righteous,

01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.956
it was doomed from the start.

01:05:05.056 --> 01:05:07.792
We've done all we could,

01:05:07.892 --> 01:05:09.761
but now it's over.

01:05:09.861 --> 01:05:11.829
I'll not have my kin die for nothing.

01:05:13.964 --> 01:05:15.732
And what are you to do?

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:20.837
I'll take Claire to safety.

01:05:22.304 --> 01:05:24.039
Then I'll turn back...

01:05:26.942 --> 01:05:28.911
back to Culloden,

01:05:29.011 --> 01:05:33.114
and fight till it's done.

01:05:40.754 --> 01:05:42.990
I'll guide yer men to safety

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:45.258
and set them on the path home.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.260
But ken this:

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.029
when ye return,

01:05:49.129 --> 01:05:51.130
I'll be waiting here
to fight by yer side.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:54.100
No.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.004
No, I said I'll not have
ye dying for nothing.

01:05:58.104 --> 01:06:01.673
I won't be.

01:06:01.773 --> 01:06:03.274
I'll be dying with you.

01:06:20.256 --> 01:06:24.060
I don't want to argue.

01:06:26.128 --> 01:06:28.130
Let's just agree

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:32.634
that I have a father who...

01:06:32.735 --> 01:06:34.168
isn't Daddy.

01:06:34.268 --> 01:06:35.770
I don't want to discuss

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:39.040
your whole time travel delusion,

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:43.777
but I do want to know more about this...

01:06:43.877 --> 01:06:45.812
Jamie Fraser.

01:06:49.249 --> 01:06:51.885
Tell me about him.

01:06:51.985 --> 01:06:53.285
Of course.

01:06:55.955 --> 01:06:58.057
All right.

01:07:01.159 --> 01:07:03.928
Uh, he was tall

01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:08.332
and had red hair just like yours.

01:07:10.768 --> 01:07:12.202
His father's name was Brian,

01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:15.806
and that's where your name came from.

01:07:18.308 --> 01:07:21.677
He spoke French, and he
loved to play chess.

01:07:21.778 --> 01:07:25.281
Uh, he had a sister,
Jenny, who's your aunt...

01:07:34.055 --> 01:07:36.792
It would take too long

01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:38.993
to tell you everything about him.

01:07:40.394 --> 01:07:42.963
But I promise I will.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.936
Today, I visited his
grave on Culloden Moor

01:07:50.036 --> 01:07:51.380
and was telling him all about you...

01:07:51.404 --> 01:07:52.872
This is the part where you lose me.

01:07:52.972 --> 01:07:56.208
I didn't intend to fall in love.

01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:01.113
In fact, I... I fought against it.

01:08:03.215 --> 01:08:07.018
But I couldn't deny what I felt for him.

01:08:07.118 --> 01:08:10.254
And I tried...

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:13.256
but I couldn't.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:18.328
It was the most powerful
thing that I've...

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.330
ever felt in my life.

01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:36.344
How is she?

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:40.013
Well, we're talking, at least.

01:08:40.113 --> 01:08:42.182
A fair improvement on shouting.

01:08:44.885 --> 01:08:46.854
Well, do... do you know Gillian Edgars?

01:08:46.954 --> 01:08:48.121
Not really.

01:08:48.221 --> 01:08:49.464
I know she gave Brianna that after...

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:51.357
Brianna's actually met her?

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.192
Yeah.

01:08:53.292 --> 01:08:54.894
Gillian's great.

01:08:54.994 --> 01:08:56.896
I mean, she's a little
crazy on the whole

01:08:56.996 --> 01:09:00.231
Scottish nationalist
thing, but I liked her.

01:09:00.331 --> 01:09:02.167
Do you know where she is now?

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:03.368
No. Why?

01:09:03.468 --> 01:09:05.003
Are you sure?

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.937
I need to find her. It's important.

01:09:07.037 --> 01:09:09.874
We... we just ran into her at the pub.

01:09:09.974 --> 01:09:12.409
Um, she said she was
leaving town tonight.

01:09:12.509 --> 01:09:15.145
Something about going somewhere
to "further the cause."

01:09:15.245 --> 01:09:18.114
Didn't sound like she would be back.

01:09:18.214 --> 01:09:20.783
She's going through the stones.

01:09:20.884 --> 01:09:22.318
We're not talking about this again.

01:09:22.418 --> 01:09:25.320
Gillian Edgars is Geillis
Duncan from the witch trial.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.821
This is her.

01:09:26.922 --> 01:09:28.423
She is the one who saved my life,

01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:30.363
and if I can stop her
going through the stones,

01:09:30.425 --> 01:09:33.028
then perhaps I can do the same for her.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:40.101
Except I can't.

01:09:40.201 --> 01:09:42.303
Why not?

01:09:42.403 --> 01:09:44.204
Because of you.

01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:46.940
Me?

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.210
When you told me that
you were a MacKenzie...

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.112
oh, I looked up your family history.

01:09:54.479 --> 01:09:56.949
Your seven-times great grandparents

01:09:57.049 --> 01:09:59.084
were William and Sara MacKenzie.

01:09:59.184 --> 01:10:01.161
They couldn't have children,
so they were given one

01:10:01.185 --> 01:10:02.954
to raise as their own.

01:10:03.054 --> 01:10:04.956
That child belonged to Dougal MacKenzie

01:10:05.056 --> 01:10:07.025
and Geillis Duncan.

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:08.435
So you're saying that my ancestors

01:10:08.459 --> 01:10:11.962
are actually the war
chief that you spoke of

01:10:12.062 --> 01:10:14.097
and the witch?

01:10:14.197 --> 01:10:16.499
Don't drag Roger into this.

01:10:16.599 --> 01:10:20.903
He has the same right as
you to know who he is.

01:10:21.003 --> 01:10:24.406
If all this is true, then we
have to stop her, don't we?

01:10:24.506 --> 01:10:27.209
If she's going back to be burned alive.

01:10:27.309 --> 01:10:28.944
You're kidding me.

01:10:29.044 --> 01:10:30.478
But what if she never goes back,

01:10:30.578 --> 01:10:33.348
never meets Dougal MacKenzie,

01:10:33.448 --> 01:10:36.251
never has their child?

01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:37.517
What if you're never born?

01:10:37.617 --> 01:10:40.254
How I can not be born? I'm here.

01:10:40.354 --> 01:10:42.122
I can't just evaporate.

01:10:42.222 --> 01:10:44.391
I don't know how this all works.

01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:50.363
Roger, you're not buying this, are you?

01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:52.131
I don't know...

01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:55.000
but just to be on the safe side,

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.135
I say we find her. Warn her, at least.

01:10:57.235 --> 01:11:00.505
Yes, I... I could warn her

01:11:00.605 --> 01:11:04.141
not to draw attention
to herself in the past.

01:11:04.241 --> 01:11:06.043
Do you see what's happening here?

01:11:06.143 --> 01:11:08.279
Roger, you are feeding her delusions.

01:11:10.547 --> 01:11:13.083
Brianna.

01:11:13.183 --> 01:11:15.018
Maybe I am.

01:11:15.118 --> 01:11:17.988
But this could be our chance
to make her actually face it.

01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:18.989
Face what?

01:11:19.089 --> 01:11:21.224
Gillian.

01:11:21.324 --> 01:11:23.058
See what Gillian says about all this.

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:25.995
And what if Gillian is
as crazy as she is?

01:11:26.095 --> 01:11:27.538
What if she really thinks
that you can travel

01:11:27.562 --> 01:11:29.431
through solid stone to the past?

01:11:29.531 --> 01:11:31.165
Well, then maybe we all get to watch her

01:11:31.265 --> 01:11:34.035
slam her head into a
five-ton block of granite.

01:11:34.135 --> 01:11:35.970
Either way, this gives us a chance

01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:37.438
to put a stop to it all.

01:11:40.273 --> 01:11:42.275
- Okay.
- I'll get my keys.

01:12:17.506 --> 01:12:19.008
Where are we going?

01:12:19.108 --> 01:12:21.610
Red Jamie won't get far, but... but you.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.979
I can save you, and I will.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.581
Well, we can leave together. Now.

01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:28.216
We could sail somewhere, anywhere.

01:12:28.316 --> 01:12:29.484
The country is roused.

01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:31.119
The ports are closed.

01:12:31.219 --> 01:12:32.587
I'm no afraid to die, Sassenach.

01:12:32.687 --> 01:12:34.355
A musket ball, maybe a blade.

01:12:34.455 --> 01:12:36.023
It's better than the hangman's noose

01:12:36.123 --> 01:12:38.025
or the wrath of the MacKenzies.

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:39.460
I'm a dead man already,

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.680
so I choose the battlefield.

01:12:40.727 --> 01:12:42.363
No. Then I will stay here with you.

01:12:42.463 --> 01:12:44.430
No, no, you won't.

01:12:46.199 --> 01:12:47.600
At the witch trial,

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.380
if I'd have gone to the
stake with Geillis,

01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:50.636
would you have left me?

01:12:50.736 --> 01:12:52.271
Left you?

01:12:52.371 --> 01:12:55.340
I would have gone to the stake with you,

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.509
to hell and beyond, if
it had gone to that,

01:12:57.609 --> 01:13:01.079
but I wasn't carrying your child.

01:13:02.613 --> 01:13:05.316
You can't know that.

01:13:05.416 --> 01:13:07.218
It's much too soon. It...

01:13:07.318 --> 01:13:09.728
Oh, Sassenach, you have not been
a day late in your courses in...

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:12.122
in all the time since ye
first took me to yer bed,

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:15.525
but it's been two months now.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:18.494
You kept track?

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.596
In the middle of this bloody war,

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:22.598
- you kept track?
- Aye.

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:24.300
How long have you known?

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:28.669
Not long.

01:13:28.769 --> 01:13:30.671
This child...

01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:33.674
this one is all

01:13:33.774 --> 01:13:37.144
that will be left of me...

01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:38.278
ever.

01:13:40.647 --> 01:13:42.616
But now, we must go,

01:13:42.716 --> 01:13:44.151
so I beg you, Claire...

01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:46.285
No, no, I can't leave you.

01:13:46.385 --> 01:13:48.587
You heard me give my word to Rupert,

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:50.223
and you made me a promise

01:13:50.323 --> 01:13:52.258
to spare Randall's life.

01:13:52.358 --> 01:13:54.692
You... you promised me
that if it came to this,

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:57.362
ye'd go back through
the stones, back home.

01:13:57.462 --> 01:13:58.730
But you are my home.

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.699
And you are mine,

01:14:01.799 --> 01:14:04.701
but this home is lost.

01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:07.704
And now you and the bairn...

01:14:07.804 --> 01:14:09.206
you must go to a safe place.

01:14:11.442 --> 01:14:13.709
To a man...

01:14:13.809 --> 01:14:15.511
A man that could care for you both.

01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:16.746
No.

01:14:18.548 --> 01:14:19.582
- No, I...
- Claire.

01:14:19.682 --> 01:14:21.184
Claire, there's no time.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.662
That's her husband's car.

01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:42.635
It's this way.

01:14:42.735 --> 01:14:44.437
Come on.

01:14:44.537 --> 01:14:45.638
What is that smell?

01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:48.474
It smells like a fuckin' barbecue.

01:15:01.786 --> 01:15:03.754
Geillis, no!

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.562
Where did she go?

01:15:12.662 --> 01:15:14.631
Oh, my God, she... she
went through the stone.

01:15:14.731 --> 01:15:16.232
She went right through it.

01:15:17.466 --> 01:15:18.701
Can you hear that?

01:15:18.801 --> 01:15:19.801
That buzzing?

01:15:19.835 --> 01:15:21.437
Aye.

01:15:21.537 --> 01:15:23.172
It's getting louder.

01:15:26.341 --> 01:15:29.511
Oh, my God.

01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.779
Roger, go get help.

01:16:31.432 --> 01:16:33.701
How will I explain all this?

01:16:35.703 --> 01:16:37.904
How can I go back?

01:16:40.474 --> 01:16:42.642
To Frank.

01:16:44.444 --> 01:16:46.479
All that I leave to you.

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:50.483
Tell him what you will about me...

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:52.751
About us.

01:16:52.851 --> 01:16:54.319
It's likely he'll no want to hear,

01:16:54.419 --> 01:16:56.421
but if he does...

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.594
Tell him I'm grateful.

01:17:04.761 --> 01:17:07.598
And tell him I trust him,

01:17:07.698 --> 01:17:10.601
and tell him I hate him to the
very marrow of his bones.

01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:15.438
The buzzing.

01:17:18.541 --> 01:17:20.343
It's so loud.

01:17:20.443 --> 01:17:23.345
I'm not ready, Jamie. I'm not ready.

01:17:23.445 --> 01:17:25.347
Come with me.

01:17:25.447 --> 01:17:26.691
Come with me through the stones.

01:17:26.715 --> 01:17:29.484
Na, I can't.

01:17:29.584 --> 01:17:31.452
You could try.

01:17:31.552 --> 01:17:32.553
You hear it, right?

01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:33.887
The buzzing?

01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:37.525
I don't hear anything, Claire.

01:17:41.794 --> 01:17:44.531
Even if I could...

01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:47.334
go back through the stones...

01:17:50.702 --> 01:17:52.671
It's not my place.

01:17:55.607 --> 01:17:57.842
My destiny lies on Culloden Moor.

01:17:59.844 --> 01:18:03.448
But I'll find you.

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:05.416
I promise.

01:18:05.516 --> 01:18:09.453
If I have to endure 200
years of purgatory...

01:18:09.553 --> 01:18:13.557
200 years without you,

01:18:13.657 --> 01:18:15.624
then that is my punishment

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:18.461
that I have earned for my crimes,

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:22.365
for I have lied, killed, stolen,

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:24.366
betrayed...

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.404
And broken trust.

01:18:33.507 --> 01:18:36.943
But when I stand before God,

01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:38.412
I'll have one thing to say

01:18:38.512 --> 01:18:40.547
to weigh against all the rest.

01:18:44.784 --> 01:18:46.952
Lord...

01:18:47.052 --> 01:18:49.722
you gave me a rare woman...

01:18:54.025 --> 01:18:56.428
And God, I loved her well.

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:53.512
It has begun.

01:20:00.117 --> 01:20:02.654
Our wedding gift

01:20:02.753 --> 01:20:04.721
from Hugh Munro.

01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:06.790
You keep it with you.

01:20:09.793 --> 01:20:13.062
Blood of my blood.

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:16.766
And bone of my bone.

01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:19.134
As long as we both shall live.

01:20:35.883 --> 01:20:37.818
Come on.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.955
This...

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.524
belonged to my father.

01:20:46.859 --> 01:20:48.927
Give it to the bairn,

01:20:49.027 --> 01:20:50.796
when he's old enough.

01:20:55.734 --> 01:20:59.069
I will name him Brian,

01:20:59.169 --> 01:21:01.639
after your father.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.929
I love you.

01:21:38.171 --> 01:21:39.940
I love you.

01:21:42.908 --> 01:21:46.145
And I you.

01:22:09.666 --> 01:22:10.867
Good-bye, Claire.

01:22:18.674 --> 01:22:21.777
It's true, then.

01:22:21.877 --> 01:22:23.612
Everything you said is true.

01:22:23.712 --> 01:22:24.813
Yes.

01:22:25.981 --> 01:22:28.916
Was that her husband?

01:22:29.016 --> 01:22:30.751
I think so.

01:22:30.851 --> 01:22:33.621
And so someone has to die to
travel through the stones.

01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:36.122
I mean, is that how it works?

01:22:36.222 --> 01:22:39.092
Geillis believed that she
needed a human sacrifice,

01:22:39.192 --> 01:22:41.795
but no one died when I went through.

01:22:45.063 --> 01:22:47.165
Wait.

01:22:47.265 --> 01:22:49.835
Is this the last place
you saw my father?

01:22:54.238 --> 01:22:55.640
Yes.

01:23:01.813 --> 01:23:03.980
I believe you.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.249
I don't understand it, but...

01:23:10.887 --> 01:23:12.154
I believe you.

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:15.691
No more lies.

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.760
From now on, I only want the truth

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.928
between you and me.

01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.029
All right?

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.935
Oh, you're so like your father.

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:28.837
Yes.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:32.205
Only the truth from now on.

01:24:02.132 --> 01:24:04.101
I've called the police,

01:24:04.201 --> 01:24:06.904
anonymously, of course,

01:24:07.003 --> 01:24:09.172
and God knows how long it'll
be before they get here.

01:24:11.941 --> 01:24:13.777
Roger.

01:24:13.877 --> 01:24:15.010
Tell her what you found.

01:24:19.782 --> 01:24:20.982
Some research the Reverend did

01:24:21.049 --> 01:24:23.951
at the request of your husband...

01:24:24.051 --> 01:24:25.119
your husband Frank.

01:24:28.122 --> 01:24:30.892
I'm not certain if he ever
sent it on to Boston.

01:24:32.392 --> 01:24:35.996
Well, what does it say?

01:24:36.096 --> 01:24:38.865
After the battle at Culloden,

01:24:38.965 --> 01:24:41.067
a few Jacobite soldiers,
all seriously wounded,

01:24:41.167 --> 01:24:43.135
took refuge in an old house...

01:24:43.235 --> 01:24:44.303
for two days,

01:24:44.403 --> 01:24:46.005
then they were all taken out to be shot,

01:24:46.105 --> 01:24:48.073
but one of them,

01:24:48.173 --> 01:24:50.142
a Fraser of the Master
of Lovat's regiment,

01:24:50.241 --> 01:24:51.843
escaped execution.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:59.249
There were a lot of Frasers
on the field that day.

01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:02.319
But... only five Fraser officers,

01:25:02.419 --> 01:25:04.254
and four of them have
their names memorialized

01:25:04.354 --> 01:25:07.257
on a plaque in the
church in Beauly, so...

01:25:07.357 --> 01:25:09.226
we know for certain
that they were killed.

01:25:12.795 --> 01:25:14.263
Who was the fifth?

01:25:17.066 --> 01:25:18.299
James Fraser.

01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:23.872
My father.

01:25:31.345 --> 01:25:32.880
Jamie.

01:25:39.318 --> 01:25:42.922
He didn't die at Culloden?

01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:44.757
Well, he meant to die, but...

01:25:46.191 --> 01:25:47.325
He didn't.

01:25:50.428 --> 01:25:53.165
He survived.

01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:58.936
He...

01:25:59.036 --> 01:26:03.139
he survived.

01:26:11.046 --> 01:26:12.147
If that's true, then...

01:26:23.925 --> 01:26:25.093
I have to go back.

01:26:44.838 --> 01:26:47.958
