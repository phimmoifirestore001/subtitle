I'll make him suffer.

He, uh...

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.238
He's spoken to the king

money from Sandringham,

00:07:05.447 --> 00:07:08.164

Aye, the duke and the prince

00:08:51.853 --> 00:08:54.187

But why'd you wait so long to tell me?

Because I...

00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:18.161

00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:29.305
and see the blood flow from his body,

00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:31.399
watch him breathe his last.

00:09:32.427 --> 00:09:33.977
But now...

00:09:34.012 --> 00:09:36.312
Jamie, you can't go back to Scotland.

00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:39.265
No, I'm not foolish enough

Nor do I intend to

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:49.766
Uh, but the Zulu, they
use chicken bones.

00:13:49.818 --> 00:13:51.651
Then you know how it works.

00:13:53.605 --> 00:13:56.239
Bring your question to mind,

00:13:56.274 --> 00:13:59.659
and cast them upon the hide.

00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:18.167
I cannot see his fate,

00:14:18.256 --> 00:14:20.140
but you have no need to worry.

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:22.165
You will see him again.

00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:31.080
I will see him again?

00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:32.271
<i>Oui.</i>

00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:35.097
That's what the bones say.

00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:37.540
But for now, you are my concern.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:46.134
For you, Madonna...

00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:48.741
for protection.

00:14:48.793 --> 00:14:50.993
It will change color in
the presence of poison.

00:14:56.222 --> 00:14:59.774
This... magic stone will keep me safe?

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.467
Some would call it nature;
some would call it magic.

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:04.692
I certainly charge
more for it when I do,

00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:07.167
but for you, Madonna, today,

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:09.743
there's no charge.

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:23.659
What do you think of my newest toy?

00:15:23.695 --> 00:15:25.444
It's m-m-marvelous.

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.623
It's a lovely clock, Louise.

00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:33.337
But I thought
you said it was urgent.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.533
Would you be a dear and feed Colette?

00:15:36.007 --> 00:15:37.590
There is fruit in the kitchen.

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:40.459
And do not put your fingers in the cage.

00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:44.607
That monkey...

00:15:44.632 --> 00:15:45.965
_

00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.101
She bites everyone but me.

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:58.257
The reason I've summoned you here...

00:15:58.813 --> 00:16:03.065
the situation is quite... delicate.

00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:08.572
I'm with child.

00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:11.072
Well...

00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:13.826
then congratulations are in order.

00:16:13.878 --> 00:16:15.338
I'm afraid not.

00:16:16.094 --> 00:16:19.712
My husband and I haven't
been intimate in months.

00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:21.940
The baby is not his.

00:16:23.122 --> 00:16:25.221
You know about these things.

00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:27.893
Will you help me?

00:16:30.527 --> 00:16:33.028
Are you sure, Louise?

00:16:33.087 --> 00:16:36.589
It was not an easy decision,
but I've made it.

00:16:39.487 --> 00:16:41.621
How shall we go about it?

00:16:43.727 --> 00:16:46.895
Well, I can make a decoction
of barberry leaves

00:16:46.896 --> 00:16:48.916
and black hellebore.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.009
Black hellebore?

00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:57.491
The very name of it sounds evil.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.122
It is bloody nasty stuff.

00:17:00.288 --> 00:17:02.171
Poison, really.

00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:03.496
It will rid you of the child,

00:17:03.521 --> 00:17:06.355
but it can also kill you.

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.713
But what other choice do I have?

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:14.529
Do you want the baby?

00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:16.804
Of course I want it. It's my lover's.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.246
It's his, it's mine. It...

00:17:22.962 --> 00:17:25.679
Could you leave Jules and marry him?

00:17:28.202 --> 00:17:31.403
He wants to marry me,

00:17:31.705 --> 00:17:34.739
but he's a dreamer.

00:17:34.764 --> 00:17:38.766
It is one thing to enjoy
an<i> affaire de coeur,</i>

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:41.542
but if Jules learns of the baby,

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.237
he will have our marriage annulled.

00:17:44.287 --> 00:17:46.788
He could even have me
arrested for adultery

00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:51.649
or, even worse, banish me to a convent.

00:17:53.302 --> 00:17:57.471
Perhaps Jules can be...

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.821
persuaded that the child is his?

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:03.480
You mean sleep with my husband?

00:18:03.611 --> 00:18:05.577
But my lover would be furious.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.560
Well, he's not the one
that's pregnant, Louise.

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:11.842
But how will I raise a child

00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:15.012
with a man who is not the father?

00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:17.823
All that matters is that...

00:18:18.587 --> 00:18:21.421
the child is brought up with love.

00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:36.033
Good evening, my beautiful wife.

00:18:36.035 --> 00:18:39.369
And how was the rest of
your day since last we met?

00:18:40.506 --> 00:18:41.955
Not bad.

00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:43.707
I take it you had a good day.

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.926
Aye, as a matter of fact, I did.

00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:47.761
Really?

00:18:47.797 --> 00:18:49.546
Are you going to tell me,
or do I have to wait?

00:18:49.598 --> 00:18:51.181
Ah.

00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:53.884
Oh, you won't have to wait
long tonight,<i> Sassenach.</i>

00:18:53.936 --> 00:18:54.885
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:03.477
What the hell is that?

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.559
Are those bite marks?

00:19:08.584 --> 00:19:10.000
Aye, well, uh,

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.309
she did get a wee bit carried away.

00:19:12.334 --> 00:19:13.917
She?

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:16.907
She... are you referring
to that brunette whore

00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:18.575
that Fergus is always talking about?

00:19:18.627 --> 00:19:21.462
No, no, it was a
different girl entirely.

00:19:21.497 --> 00:19:24.047
Oh, it was a different girl entirely.

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:25.833
What, that makes it better?

00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:29.586
And how exactly did this
different girl entirely

00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:31.221
manage to bite your thighs?

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.140
There is a simple explanation.

00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:35.008
Well, I should hope so.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.677
Well, I don't suppose a
gently reared young lady

00:19:36.729 --> 00:19:37.978
such as yourself would be familiar

00:19:38.013 --> 00:19:40.514
with the term<i> soixante-neuf?</i>

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:43.433
Oh, I know what sixty-nine is.

00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:45.686
Ah, well, she was rather
insistent about it,

00:19:45.738 --> 00:19:47.688
although I think she would've
settled for the six.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.939
The nine could go hang.

00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:50.107
I suppose she was so insistent,

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:51.942
you just had to accommodate her.

00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:54.778
No, no, I did not.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.497
Ye have to believe me,
Claire, nothin' happened.

00:19:56.532 --> 00:19:59.666
Oh, so I'm supposed to believe

00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:01.702
that you got those bites
defending your virtue?

00:20:01.754 --> 00:20:03.086
Well, I didna say I wasna tempted.

00:20:03.122 --> 00:20:05.539
I wanted to, badly.

00:20:05.591 --> 00:20:09.042
Yeah, I was filled with lust, but, eh...

00:20:09.094 --> 00:20:11.211
yeah, I don't think I'm
explaining this properly.

00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:13.013
No, I don't think you are,

00:20:13.048 --> 00:20:14.798
because so far the only
thing that you've explained

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.551
is that while you've barely
touched me in months,

00:20:17.603 --> 00:20:20.270
tonight you were driven mad
with passion by some whore.

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.889
Yes! No!

00:20:21.941 --> 00:20:24.057
Well, that's the great
thing, don't you see?

00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:26.977
I... I've tried f-for so long
to find a way back to you,

00:20:26.979 --> 00:20:28.862
but to not see

00:20:28.898 --> 00:20:30.981
that bastard's face every
time I take you in my arms.

00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:34.034
But tonight I started ta...
ta feel like a man again.

00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:35.485
With another woman!

00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:37.321
Nothing happened.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:39.573
And it was actually you
that made me believe

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:41.458
it was possible in the first place.

00:20:44.496 --> 00:20:45.662
Me?

00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:47.331
Aye.

00:20:47.383 --> 00:20:51.418
You told me Randall is alive,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.720
and now I can be the
one to end his life.

00:20:55.257 --> 00:20:57.257
You know, it lifted
something from my heart.

00:20:57.309 --> 00:21:02.650
I began to feel I should stir
up those feelings inside myself

00:21:02.765 --> 00:21:06.350
so I could feel that way
again with my wife.

00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:09.186
So you had to stir
yourself up with a whore

00:21:09.238 --> 00:21:11.104
before you could bring
yourself to be with me?

00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:13.190
No, that's not what I was...

00:21:13.242 --> 00:21:15.359
you know I've been
struggling for a long time.

00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:17.694
Struggling?

00:21:17.696 --> 00:21:21.281
Do you know what I've
been struggling with?

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:25.168
Trying to be patient with
you and understanding,

00:21:25.204 --> 00:21:26.503
and all the while, I've been...

00:21:26.538 --> 00:21:28.338
I've been dealing with
carrying our child.

00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:31.291
'Course I do.

00:21:31.343 --> 00:21:33.844
We've barely even talked about it.

00:21:35.965 --> 00:21:38.215
W-we-we hadn't even talked
about babies' names

00:21:38.217 --> 00:21:42.519
until Duverney brought it up
at your stupid chess game!

00:21:43.722 --> 00:21:45.305
I feel like I've been going

00:21:45.357 --> 00:21:47.274
through all of this all on my own.

00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:48.775
I'm here.

00:21:48.811 --> 00:21:50.193
<i>I am with you,</i>

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:52.195
and we will have this child together.

00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:53.730
But I don't think you
understand what it's been like

00:21:53.782 --> 00:21:56.400
for me since...

00:21:56.452 --> 00:21:58.368
since what happened at Wentworth.

00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:02.372
Well, then tell me, God damn it.

00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:05.659
Talk to me! Make me understand!

00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:20.891
There was
this place inside me I...

00:22:20.926 --> 00:22:23.727
a place I think everyone has
that they keep to themselves.

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:30.434
A fortress...

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:35.856
Where the most private
part of you lives.

00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:41.278
Maybe it's your soul,

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.331
the bit that makes you
yourself and not anyone else.

00:22:46.752 --> 00:22:49.503
But after Wentworth,

00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:54.508
it was like... my... fortress
had been blown apart.

00:22:54.543 --> 00:22:56.460
The thing that once lived
there was suddenly exposed,

00:22:56.512 --> 00:22:58.595
out in the open, without shelter,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.796
without...

00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:11.024
That's where I've been
ever since, Claire.

00:23:13.812 --> 00:23:15.479
Naked.

00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:18.865
Alone.

00:23:20.452 --> 00:23:23.487
Trying... to hide

00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:26.039
under a blade of grass.

00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:39.836
Think it best I sleep elsewhere tonight.

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:27.517
- Claire.
- Shh.

00:24:27.553 --> 00:24:28.718
Don't say a word.

00:24:35.727 --> 00:24:37.894
Come find me, Jamie.

00:24:40.115 --> 00:24:42.866
Come find me.

00:24:42.901 --> 00:24:44.901
Find us.

00:26:00.412 --> 00:26:03.079
Remember I told you I was lost?

00:26:05.884 --> 00:26:08.852
You were trying to hide
under a blade of grass.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.790
Well, I think...

00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:17.694
perhaps you've built me a lean-to...

00:26:17.729 --> 00:26:18.795
at the least.

00:26:23.168 --> 00:26:24.301
Hmm.

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:26.870
And a roof...

00:26:26.905 --> 00:26:29.072
to keep out the rain.

00:26:34.846 --> 00:26:36.096
What?

00:26:38.016 --> 00:26:39.015
Shh.

00:26:50.412 --> 00:26:52.329
What is it?

00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:06.593
There's someone on the roof.

00:27:30.819 --> 00:27:32.319
James!

00:27:32.371 --> 00:27:34.454
JAMIE: (SPEAKING GAELIC)

00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:38.375
Forgive me.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.077
I do not usually arrive so,

00:27:41.129 --> 00:27:44.881
without ceremony or at
such an unsocial hour.

00:27:46.335 --> 00:27:49.302
My house is at your service,

00:27:49.338 --> 00:27:51.304
Your Highness.

00:28:09.157 --> 00:28:11.441
May I present my wife?

00:28:11.443 --> 00:28:14.361
Claire Fraser...

00:28:14.413 --> 00:28:16.329
Lady Broch Tuarach.

00:28:16.365 --> 00:28:18.281
Claire, this is His Royal Highness,

00:28:18.283 --> 00:28:20.250
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,

00:28:20.285 --> 00:28:22.118
the future king of Britain.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.421
I'd rather gathered that.

00:28:24.456 --> 00:28:27.624
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

00:28:29.544 --> 00:28:32.212
A pleasure to meet you, madame.

00:28:35.183 --> 00:28:38.218
<i>Has Your Royal
Highness been hurt?</i>

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.602
Your hand.

00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:45.692
Indeed, I suffered a ghastly
and painful injury.

00:28:45.727 --> 00:28:46.976
You'll have a look at it,

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:48.945
and I'll need a whisky too.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.447
Ah.

00:28:53.368 --> 00:28:56.486
I found myself in a rather
embarrassing position

00:28:56.538 --> 00:28:59.155
at the house of a friend.

00:28:59.157 --> 00:29:01.458
I was forced to flee.

00:29:01.493 --> 00:29:03.126
Unable to use the front door,

00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:06.246
I departed out of the
window and onto a roof.

00:29:06.298 --> 00:29:07.547
I had a rare time,

00:29:07.582 --> 00:29:09.716
dodging chimneys,
slipping on wet slates,

00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:13.720
until it occurred to me your
house was down the row.

00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:16.639
She swore she loved me countless times.

00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:20.593
Then tonight, she spurns
me without warning.

00:29:20.645 --> 00:29:24.064
We were quarreling when her
husband arrived home early.

00:29:29.763 --> 00:29:32.848
God is forever testing me,

00:29:32.978 --> 00:29:36.679
placing obstacles in my path.

00:29:36.704 --> 00:29:38.004
I've overcome every one of them.

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:39.946
I'll overcome this one too.

00:29:40.265 --> 00:29:41.431
I won't be deterred.

00:29:41.533 --> 00:29:43.283
Mark me,

00:29:43.335 --> 00:29:45.668
I will win her back.

00:29:49.234 --> 00:29:52.151
I don't believe it will require sutures.

00:29:52.176 --> 00:29:54.093
It should heal quite quickly.

00:29:54.118 --> 00:29:56.418
It appears to be a bite.

00:29:57.849 --> 00:29:59.265
An epidemic around here.

00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:00.717
Aye.

00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:02.352
Her pet!

00:30:02.387 --> 00:30:05.555
It bites everyone apart from her.

00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:09.726
Ill-tempered, flea-ridden beast.

00:30:09.728 --> 00:30:11.361
By any chance,

00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:13.363
was this bite by a monkey?

00:30:23.492 --> 00:30:26.743
Charles and Louise?

00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:28.912
I never suspected either.

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:33.249
But now I think about it,

00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:34.834
they are both dreamers.

00:30:37.339 --> 00:30:39.389
And both live in a...

00:30:39.424 --> 00:30:42.058
fantasy world.

00:30:42.093 --> 00:30:43.927
Hmm.

00:30:45.847 --> 00:30:47.981
They're perfect for each other.

00:30:57.742 --> 00:31:00.243
Can't believe I'm thinking this, but...

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:02.362
Believe I was thinkin'
the very same thing.

00:31:03.832 --> 00:31:07.116
We use their affair to our advantage.

00:31:07.118 --> 00:31:09.285
Get Charles and Louise in
the same room together.

00:31:09.287 --> 00:31:14.207
Aye, we invite Louise to
the dinner next week,

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:15.959
along with her husband.

00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:17.927
And if Charles hasn't heard
about the baby by then...

00:31:17.963 --> 00:31:20.463
We make sure he does, right
in front of the duke.

00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:21.965
He'll come unhinged.

00:31:22.017 --> 00:31:24.267
We use his broken heart

00:31:24.302 --> 00:31:25.852
to break his bank.

00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:31.808
Oh, God.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.143
Does this make us bad people?

00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:40.984
Way I see it,

00:31:41.036 --> 00:31:42.952
we're doing a bad thing,

00:31:42.988 --> 00:31:45.822
but for a good reason.

00:31:45.874 --> 00:31:48.825
Isn't that what all bad people say?

00:32:19.524 --> 00:32:21.524
Where are you off to?
The dinner's tonight.

00:32:21.526 --> 00:32:24.410
I know. I got word there's an
explosion at the Royal Armory.

00:32:24.446 --> 00:32:26.579
Several of the victims
have gone to the hospital.

00:32:26.615 --> 00:32:28.831
Besides, Madame Vionnet never
lets me near the kitchen,

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:31.167
and I'd rather be somewhere I'm needed.

00:32:32.587 --> 00:32:35.004
I promise, I'll be home before sunset.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.039
All right.

00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:38.374
But take Murtagh with you.

00:32:38.376 --> 00:32:40.376
Fergus too.

00:32:40.378 --> 00:32:42.128
Have her home in time
to dress for dinner,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.596
if you expect to eat yerself.

00:32:43.632 --> 00:32:45.548
You have my word.

00:32:56.194 --> 00:32:58.561
<i>Yah, yah.</i>

00:33:00.365 --> 00:33:02.115
Madame Fraser asked that I let you know

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.950
that it's going to be
at least another hour.

00:33:03.985 --> 00:33:05.902
No, but I-I promised Milord ..

00:33:05.904 --> 00:33:06.903
She knows.

00:33:06.955 --> 00:33:08.621
We'll hurry.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.626
It's a shame Miss Hawkins is so sad.

00:33:13.662 --> 00:33:15.161
Sad?

00:33:15.213 --> 00:33:17.246
That hen was smiling from ear to ear.

00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:19.549
Did you really not see
that she had been crying?

00:33:19.584 --> 00:33:21.384
I saw no crying.

00:33:21.419 --> 00:33:23.503
That's why you will die
with<i> la veuve poignet.</i>

00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:26.255
Alone with your hand.

00:33:27.976 --> 00:33:29.559
Give me that.

00:33:32.063 --> 00:33:33.980
She's promised to wed the vicomte,

00:33:34.015 --> 00:33:35.515
yet she's in love with another.

00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:37.433
In love?

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:39.519
You jes said she was sad.

00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:42.155
I-I-I know, but t-there is...

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.325
_

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.528
Because... in spite of da crying,

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.446
she's wearing...

00:33:50.471 --> 00:33:51.571
_

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.750
And there is a...

00:33:54.038 --> 00:33:54.842
_

00:33:56.004 --> 00:33:58.621
A-a-a spring in her step,

00:33:58.623 --> 00:34:01.674
and her speech, which does not flow,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.343
now runs like a...

00:34:03.378 --> 00:34:04.761
a-a sparkling stream.

00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:06.796
One, I dinna care.

00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:09.632
Two, a man doesna concern himself

00:34:09.684 --> 00:34:11.100
with the affairs of women.

00:34:15.106 --> 00:34:18.608
Suzette, the lady's maid...

00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:20.276
is she in love with anyone?

00:34:20.311 --> 00:34:22.061
Her?

00:34:22.113 --> 00:34:25.314
<i>Oui,</i> with any man who
walks past her door.

00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:27.700
Never mind, ye wee smout.

00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:39.045
Aah... aah!

00:34:59.267 --> 00:35:00.733
That's incredible.

00:35:00.769 --> 00:35:02.485
What did you do?

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.320
There is a nerve there,

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:06.406
and if you are fortunate
enough to pierce it directly,

00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:11.277
it numbs the sensation in
ze lower extremity, hmm?

00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:13.112
We must work quickly.

00:35:13.164 --> 00:35:14.864
Hold ze foot steady. Mm.

00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:30.213
This ointment will ease
ze pain of ze burns.

00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:32.215
What is it?

00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:35.551
Hangman's grease.

00:35:35.603 --> 00:35:38.688
Rendered fat from 'anged criminals.

00:35:38.723 --> 00:35:40.356
Uh-huh.

00:35:49.567 --> 00:35:53.402
Mary, why don't you step
outside for some air?

00:35:53.404 --> 00:35:55.404
I need to wash my hands first.

00:36:00.578 --> 00:36:02.912
Where would he get such a thing?

00:36:02.964 --> 00:36:05.414
When Monsieur Forez is not with us,

00:36:05.467 --> 00:36:08.885
he serves as His Majesty's
royal executioner.

00:36:10.972 --> 00:36:13.422
That's a peculiar calling.

00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:16.843
We take what God sends us.

00:36:16.895 --> 00:36:19.262
Still, ze bulk of our physicians

00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:21.764
are better zan nussing.

00:36:21.766 --> 00:36:26.402
You, madame, are a great
deal better zan nussing.

00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:29.605
Thank you.

00:36:50.962 --> 00:36:52.929
The wheel's broken.

00:36:52.964 --> 00:36:55.298
I sent Fergus ahead to
tell Jamie we'll be late.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.767
Oh, Christ, today of all days.

00:36:57.802 --> 00:37:00.937
I promised Jamie I'd be
home to greet our guests.

00:37:00.972 --> 00:37:04.023
Now we'll never make it.

00:37:04.058 --> 00:37:06.642
We'll have to walk.

00:37:06.694 --> 00:37:07.977
<i>Now.</i>

00:37:11.649 --> 00:37:14.483
His Grace, the Honorable
Clarence Marylebone,

00:37:14.485 --> 00:37:16.903
<i>the third duke of Sandringham.</i>

00:37:24.412 --> 00:37:28.915
Jamie, what a vision of elegance.

00:37:28.967 --> 00:37:32.001
A man who always manages
to look fashionable,

00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:33.419
whatever the setting.

00:37:33.471 --> 00:37:34.887
Welcome, Your Grace.

00:37:34.923 --> 00:37:37.256
Pleased to meet you, Lord Broch Tuarach.

00:37:37.308 --> 00:37:38.558
Alex is my secretary.

00:37:38.593 --> 00:37:40.009
Oh, of course, you know his brother,

00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:41.143
Captain Randall.

00:37:43.932 --> 00:37:46.349
Aye.

00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:48.100
We're acquainted.

00:37:48.152 --> 00:37:49.352
Hmm, run along now, Alex.

00:37:49.354 --> 00:37:51.020
Go and assist the servants.

00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:53.239
Uh, yes, Your Grace, and I
shall dine with the butler.

00:37:54.993 --> 00:37:57.026
Mr. Silas Hawkins...

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.697
Welcome, sir. You must be Mary's uncle?

00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:03.616
My wife is very fond of the lass.

00:38:03.668 --> 00:38:05.751
My niece spends entirely too much time

00:38:05.787 --> 00:38:08.337
engaging in social activity.

00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:12.041
May I present the Vicomte Marigny,

00:38:12.093 --> 00:38:14.010
her fiancé?

00:38:14.045 --> 00:38:18.681
Monsieur Jean Ribes et
Madame Anne-Marie Ribes.

00:38:18.716 --> 00:38:20.466
Monsieur et Madame LeClaire.

00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:29.141
That's the last time I'm going
to tell you how to do that.

00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:35.615
Milord, there is a problem
with the carriage.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:39.485
There would be lateness involved.

00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:43.572
His Royal Highness,
Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:51.163
Your Royal Highness.

00:38:51.215 --> 00:38:52.665
Welcome.

00:38:52.717 --> 00:38:55.001
High hopes, James.

00:38:55.053 --> 00:38:59.005
Mark me, tonight could be
a turning point for us.

00:38:59.057 --> 00:39:02.508
Aye,
I believe it will be.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.176
Your Royal Highness,

00:39:04.228 --> 00:39:07.263
may I present the Honorable
Clarence Marylebone,

00:39:07.315 --> 00:39:09.181
third duke of Sandringham?

00:39:09.233 --> 00:39:11.267
<i>Your Grace,</i>

00:39:11.319 --> 00:39:12.601
may I present His Royal Highness,

00:39:12.654 --> 00:39:15.604
Prince Charles Edward Stuart?

00:39:18.326 --> 00:39:21.661
Such a delight finally to meet you.

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:25.281
I've heard such grand praise.

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:28.034
The feeling is quite mutual, Your Grace.

00:39:28.086 --> 00:39:30.286
<i>Monsieur Christophe Bessette</i>

00:39:30.338 --> 00:39:32.288
<i>et Lady Bessette.</i>

00:39:35.877 --> 00:39:38.344
I've met someone I find most intriguing.

00:39:38.379 --> 00:39:41.213
We've been corresponding
in secret for weeks now.

00:39:41.265 --> 00:39:43.182
Really?

00:39:43.217 --> 00:39:45.301
Do tell.

00:39:45.353 --> 00:39:48.354
He's handsome, intelligent,

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:50.222
and his letters are of such eloquence,

00:39:50.274 --> 00:39:52.641
I couldn't help but
fall in love with him.

00:39:52.694 --> 00:39:54.643
Well, who is this gentleman?

00:39:56.197 --> 00:39:57.613
<i>Oh, I shouldn't tell you this,</i>

00:39:57.648 --> 00:40:00.399
but his name's Randall.

00:40:04.405 --> 00:40:05.654
Randall?

00:40:05.707 --> 00:40:07.656
What?

00:40:09.627 --> 00:40:12.161
Well, how did you meet him?

00:40:12.163 --> 00:40:15.247
I dropped my handkerchief,
and he picked it up.

00:40:15.299 --> 00:40:17.166
It was so romantic.

00:40:17.168 --> 00:40:18.667
Where was this?

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.503
At Versailles.

00:40:20.555 --> 00:40:22.638
Remember, when you wore the red dress.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.810
You're speaking of Alex Randall.

00:40:27.845 --> 00:40:30.596
Yes.

00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:31.647
Is there another?

00:40:35.686 --> 00:40:36.736
Murtagh!

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:58.547
_

00:40:59.071 --> 00:41:00.753
_

00:41:05.489 --> 00:41:07.844
_

00:41:15.623 --> 00:41:17.770
_

00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:20.329
- No, please, no!
- Leave her alone!

00:41:21.632 --> 00:41:24.333
Le Comte et la Comtesse St. Germain.

00:41:24.385 --> 00:41:27.386
_

00:41:27.728 --> 00:41:30.267
_

00:41:30.925 --> 00:41:33.676
I took the liberty of inviting
my associate the comte.

00:41:33.728 --> 00:41:36.762
<i>It should be easy to place
two more settings at table.</i>

00:41:40.852 --> 00:41:42.568
Delighted.

00:41:51.978 --> 00:41:53.775
_

00:41:55.377 --> 00:41:57.346
_

00:41:57.785 --> 00:41:59.451
<i>La Dame Blanche.</i>

00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:02.922
Ah!

00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:05.925
Huh?

00:42:06.221 --> 00:42:07.814
_

00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:09.541
_

00:42:12.813 --> 00:42:15.040
_

00:42:26.898 --> 00:42:29.114
Général D'Arbanville.

00:42:31.452 --> 00:42:33.118
General, pleased you could come.

00:42:33.154 --> 00:42:36.739
I've been looking forward to it.

00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:38.657
Le Marquis de Rohan

00:42:38.709 --> 00:42:41.877
et Madame Louise de la
Tour Marquise de Rohan.

00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:47.833
You're most welcome.

00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:51.720
<i>Allow me to introduce to
you His Royal Highness,</i>

00:42:51.756 --> 00:42:54.807
Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

00:42:58.729 --> 00:43:00.312
A pleasure, Your Royal Highness.

00:43:00.348 --> 00:43:02.264
Indeed.

00:43:05.319 --> 00:43:07.570
A rare jewel you've brought.

00:43:28.259 --> 00:43:29.258
Milord.

00:43:48.613 --> 00:43:50.279
What happened?

00:43:50.314 --> 00:43:52.031
We were attacked on the street.

00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:54.033
- Four brigands.
- I tried to fight them off.

00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:56.819
Are you hurt,<i> Sassenach?</i>
The bairn, is it...

00:43:56.871 --> 00:43:58.237
No, we're okay.

00:43:58.289 --> 00:44:02.324
But Mary, she was assaulted and raped.

00:44:02.376 --> 00:44:05.878
- Good God, w-what...
- No, no, no, monsieur...

00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:08.247
It's all right. It's all right.

00:44:09.967 --> 00:44:11.634
She's hurt badly,

00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:13.919
and passed out from the shock,

00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:15.754
<i>but she'll be all right.</i>

00:44:16.974 --> 00:44:18.641
- Did you recognize them?
- No.

00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:20.676
- They wore masks.
- Then we shall find them.

00:44:20.728 --> 00:44:21.760
Aye, let's go.

00:44:21.812 --> 00:44:23.312
No.

00:44:23.347 --> 00:44:24.396
Not now.

00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:26.815
Tonight is too important.

00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:30.069
What we're going to do is we're
going to look after this poor girl.

00:44:30.104 --> 00:44:32.154
Take her up to the guest
room where she'll be safe.

00:44:32.189 --> 00:44:34.189
Fergus, go get my medical box.

00:44:34.241 --> 00:44:35.691
<i>Tout de suite,</i> Milady.

00:44:35.743 --> 00:44:38.243
Suzette, you can help me dress.

00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:40.612
Are you daft, woman?

00:44:40.665 --> 00:44:43.082
Help me get her inside.

00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:44.783
We'll take the back staircase.

00:44:44.835 --> 00:44:46.869
No one will see us.

00:45:03.137 --> 00:45:06.138
Can you stay with her?

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.107
She needs some quiet and rest.

00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:10.392
<i>I won't leave her side.</i>

00:45:10.444 --> 00:45:13.445
If she wakes up, give
her some water or tea,

00:45:13.481 --> 00:45:15.314
and this poppy syrup.

00:45:15.316 --> 00:45:17.149
<i>Not too much, as it can cause visions.</i>

00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:20.035
I've already given her a dose.

00:45:24.742 --> 00:45:26.492
Dinner's not served.

00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:31.997
We can still cancel, send everyone home.

00:45:31.999 --> 00:45:34.299
No, I've told you,

00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.335
there's too much at stake.

00:45:36.337 --> 00:45:38.337
We need to alert the
authorities about Mary.

00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:41.173
We can't.

00:45:41.225 --> 00:45:44.727
Mary's uncle and fiancé are here.

00:45:44.762 --> 00:45:47.346
If she's been violated, her
reputation will be ruined.

00:45:47.348 --> 00:45:49.314
It's hardly her fault she was raped.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.517
I know it isna right, but
if we let it be known

00:45:51.569 --> 00:45:54.269
she's a maiden no more, no
man will ever take her.

00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:56.155
She'll be a spinster till
the end of her days.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.356
That's ridiculous!

00:45:57.408 --> 00:45:58.490
She needs a doctor.

00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:00.409
She has one.

00:46:00.444 --> 00:46:03.028
You.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.280
I'd lay odds that black-hearted bastard

00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:07.082
St. Germain was behind this.

00:46:07.118 --> 00:46:09.334
I should go out there right
now and cut his head off.

00:46:10.871 --> 00:46:12.454
What do you mean?

00:46:12.506 --> 00:46:14.206
He's here?

00:46:16.127 --> 00:46:17.876
Aye.

00:46:17.878 --> 00:46:20.045
In the parlor. The duke invited him.

00:46:20.097 --> 00:46:22.014
Christ!

00:46:22.049 --> 00:46:25.050
No one is getting their
head cut off tonight.

00:46:25.052 --> 00:46:26.852
You should go.

00:46:29.523 --> 00:46:32.274
I'll let the guests know you're here.

00:46:33.944 --> 00:46:35.060
I'll be right there.

00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:44.403
Oh... deep breath.

00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:49.291
Okay?

00:46:49.326 --> 00:46:50.909
Let's go.

00:47:10.147 --> 00:47:13.899
Mesdames et messieurs, Your
Grace, Your Royal Highness,

00:47:13.934 --> 00:47:18.437
allow me to present my
wife, Claire Fraser,

00:47:18.439 --> 00:47:19.905
Lady Broch Tuarach.

00:47:24.111 --> 00:47:26.495
So wonderful to see you all.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.615
My sincerest apologies for my delay.

00:47:29.667 --> 00:47:30.970
You must be famished.

00:47:30.995 --> 00:47:33.019
_

00:47:36.006 --> 00:47:37.956
So good to see you.

00:47:37.958 --> 00:47:39.708
How's everything at home?

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.460
I've told him.

00:47:41.462 --> 00:47:44.513
I convinced him it happened
on a drunken night...

00:47:44.548 --> 00:47:46.298
the baby is his.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.267
He was mad with joy.

00:47:53.557 --> 00:47:54.723
Shh.

00:47:54.775 --> 00:47:57.976
Sleep now, I'm here.

00:47:58.028 --> 00:47:59.778
You're safe now.

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:08.620
I love you, Mary.

00:48:08.656 --> 00:48:13.242
I'll take good care of you.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:36.231
Lovely.

00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:40.819
We're fortunate to have
His Royal Highness

00:48:40.854 --> 00:48:42.271
with us from Italy.

00:48:42.323 --> 00:48:45.324
What a resplendent country.

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:47.075
I had occasion to visit it last year.

00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:51.163
My one disappointment was
my trip to the Vatican.

00:48:51.198 --> 00:48:52.497
<i>His Grace was just telling me</i>

00:48:52.533 --> 00:48:54.583
he wished to meet Pope Benedict.

00:48:54.618 --> 00:48:59.371
Yes, but he was too busy to receive me.

00:48:59.423 --> 00:49:02.507
And what do popes do anyway?

00:49:02.543 --> 00:49:05.544
Does anyone know?

00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:08.213
I imagine being leader
of the Catholic Church

00:49:08.265 --> 00:49:10.382
keeps him rather occupied.

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:13.185
<i>Yes.</i>

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.219
Have you met him?

00:49:14.271 --> 00:49:15.771
Indeed.

00:49:15.806 --> 00:49:19.224
He's been exceedingly
generous to my family.

00:49:19.276 --> 00:49:21.727
As have the past four popes.

00:49:21.779 --> 00:49:24.313
I just wanted to ascertain
whether the Pope

00:49:24.365 --> 00:49:26.732
is as witty as they say.

00:49:26.734 --> 00:49:29.901
The man's celebrated across
Rome for his<i> bon mots.</i>

00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:33.705
You've been known to tell a
joke or two, Your Grace.

00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:35.407
Perhaps you'd favor us?

00:49:35.459 --> 00:49:37.876
Oh, no, I really don't...
Uh, well... pffft...

00:49:37.911 --> 00:49:40.412
Well, I mean...

00:49:40.464 --> 00:49:42.914
Just the one. Uh...

00:49:42.967 --> 00:49:45.500
What did the dwarf say

00:49:45.552 --> 00:49:49.471
when asked for 5 shillings?

00:49:49.506 --> 00:49:52.257
"Apologies, I'm a trifle short."

00:50:02.686 --> 00:50:04.820
<i>Still reeling from the attack,</i>

00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:07.439
<i>I couldn't help staring at St. Germain</i>

00:50:07.491 --> 00:50:09.274
<i>and wondering whether he could have</i>

00:50:09.276 --> 00:50:10.859
<i>orchestrated such violence</i>

00:50:10.911 --> 00:50:13.779
<i>and then sat calmly
across the table from me</i>

00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:16.915
<i>two hours later, sipping his soup.</i>

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:20.002
Your Royal Highness, perhaps
we should enlighten His Grace

00:50:20.037 --> 00:50:21.920
<i>as to some of your plans.</i>

00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:23.538
God's plans?

00:50:24.425 --> 00:50:26.208
Mark me,

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.795
His are the only plans that matter.

00:50:29.847 --> 00:50:32.798
It is His plan that I,

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.933
as His emissary,

00:50:34.968 --> 00:50:39.221
unite the clans and restore
a Catholic to the throne.

00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:41.056
Must we talk politics?

00:50:41.108 --> 00:50:43.809
It's so dreary.

00:50:43.811 --> 00:50:44.943
What about the opera?

00:50:44.978 --> 00:50:46.478
Ah!

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.281
Has anyone attended Lully's
"Acis and Galatée"?

00:50:49.316 --> 00:50:51.233
Of course, we all have!

00:50:51.285 --> 00:50:54.069
My husband and I found it breathtaking.

00:50:54.121 --> 00:50:55.987
Are you married, sir?

00:50:58.125 --> 00:51:00.158
It's a wonderment,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.129
but I have not yet found a woman
who would put up with me.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.918
Well, they are fickle creatures, indeed.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.338
Well, Jamie managed to
find himself a worthy one.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.006
<i>I must say,</i>

00:51:15.059 --> 00:51:18.844
I think combination of
their respective beauties

00:51:18.896 --> 00:51:23.265
will result in a child of
unfathomable pulchritude.

00:51:23.317 --> 00:51:24.850
<i>Merci.</i>

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.157
I understand congratulations
are in order

00:51:32.192 --> 00:51:34.409
for Madame and the Marquis as well.

00:51:36.997 --> 00:51:39.948
Why, yes, um...

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.251
we are looking forward to the
arrival of a little one.

00:51:43.287 --> 00:51:45.120
I apologize, I thought...

00:51:45.172 --> 00:51:48.290
We haven't formally
announced it yet, uh,

00:51:48.342 --> 00:51:50.041
but... an heir!

00:51:50.094 --> 00:51:53.261
It's the most incredible
news, is it not?

00:51:57.968 --> 00:52:01.353
Well, then...

00:52:01.388 --> 00:52:04.272
I am to congratulate you.

00:52:04.308 --> 00:52:09.060
I wish you and the Marquis all
the happiness in the world.

00:52:09.062 --> 00:52:11.313
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

00:52:11.365 --> 00:52:13.198
<i>- Santé.
- Santé.</i>

00:52:13.233 --> 00:52:14.616
<i>- Santé.</i>

00:52:19.072 --> 00:52:23.992
Of course, the world is
not always a happy place.

00:52:24.044 --> 00:52:26.161
It's quite unpredictable, really.

00:52:26.213 --> 00:52:30.298
One day you're happy, and the next...

00:52:30.334 --> 00:52:34.052
<i>porca miseria.</i>

00:52:34.087 --> 00:52:35.504
Your pardon, sir,

00:52:35.556 --> 00:52:38.590
but I'm a little in the
dark as to your meaning.

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:41.643
Yes.

00:52:41.678 --> 00:52:45.263
I believe you are a man
"in the dark," indeed.

00:52:56.193 --> 00:52:58.527
It's all right. I'm here.

00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:03.865
Mary...

00:53:03.917 --> 00:53:05.667
No, no, no, get away from me!

00:53:05.702 --> 00:53:08.420
Everything's all right. Here,
I'll get your medicine.

00:53:17.764 --> 00:53:19.297
That is a beautiful stone

00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:21.766
you wear around your neck, Madame.

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:24.186
Oh, it's just a bauble.

00:53:24.805 --> 00:53:27.355
_

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:31.828
_

00:53:32.281 --> 00:53:34.352
_

00:53:34.937 --> 00:53:38.102
_

00:53:38.613 --> 00:53:42.746
_

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:54.187
_

00:53:54.523 --> 00:53:56.777
_

00:53:59.723 --> 00:54:01.723
_

00:54:07.731 --> 00:54:10.148
Mary, wait, it's all right!

00:54:12.686 --> 00:54:15.186
- Mary, Mary!
- No! Get off me!

00:54:15.239 --> 00:54:16.571
I'm not trying to hurt you!

00:54:16.607 --> 00:54:17.739
No!

00:54:17.774 --> 00:54:18.773
_

00:54:22.779 --> 00:54:25.196
<i>No! No, get off me!</i>

00:54:29.369 --> 00:54:31.202
_

00:54:32.422 --> 00:54:34.372
Mary!

00:54:34.374 --> 00:54:35.373
It's all right.

00:54:35.398 --> 00:54:36.557
_

00:54:36.593 --> 00:54:38.677
- Gentlemen, be reasonable.
- Mary!

00:54:38.712 --> 00:54:40.595
What on earth are you doing here?

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:43.965
Ruined! You ruined my niece!

00:54:44.017 --> 00:54:45.884
She is my fiancé!

00:54:47.471 --> 00:54:49.387
Mary, come with me.

00:54:49.389 --> 00:54:51.523
I was so looking forward to dessert...

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.364
But I suppose it is getting rather late.

00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:07.405
Stop it, everyone, at once!

00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:12.243
(SPEAKING GAELIC)

00:55:12.296 --> 00:55:13.745
Haaah!

00:55:13.797 --> 00:55:16.998
There is no reason to be uncivil!

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.718
Yes, and Your Highness
should not be subjected

00:55:19.753 --> 00:55:20.885
to such intemperance.

00:55:20.921 --> 00:55:23.004
Let us depart.

00:55:23.056 --> 00:55:26.591
I regret leaving my friend
James with these...

00:55:26.593 --> 00:55:27.676
ruffians.

00:55:30.981 --> 00:55:32.731
Ooh!

00:55:32.766 --> 00:55:34.899
Don't
trouble yourself.

00:55:34.935 --> 00:55:36.484
I will take care of it.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.019
<i>Merci.</i>

00:55:39.856 --> 00:55:41.356
_

00:55:54.955 --> 00:55:56.705
Ah!

00:55:59.459 --> 00:56:01.593
Ah!

00:56:01.628 --> 00:56:03.544
