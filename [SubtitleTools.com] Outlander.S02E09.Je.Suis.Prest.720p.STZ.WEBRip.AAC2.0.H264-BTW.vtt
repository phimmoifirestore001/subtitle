00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.679
and I will lead you all to glory.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.343
Charles has landed in Scotland,

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:30.776

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:32.011
What will ye do, brother?

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:33.612
Whatever I can to save Lallybroch,

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:35.981
Scotland, and everything
that we hold dear.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:38.214
I need you to bring
the men to Kingussie.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:39.140

<i>JAMIE: I'll meet you there in two weeks.</i>

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:41.987
Colum, is Dougal with ye?

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:43.322
'Twas best for the clan

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.157
that my brother remain
at his own estate.

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.059
To save our clans, our country,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.327
we must band together.

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:49.662
Let's just go to Prince Charles

00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:50.830
with the men from Lallybroch.

00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:52.298
I canna go to the prince a failure.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.834
It's our duty to stand up
for our country, Father.

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.802
I will fight, even if you will not.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:59.972
Don't sit there gaping at me.
Go see to your men!

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.774
I don't understand.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.342
What will you say about your son
fighting for the Jacobites?

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:04.910
He's his own man,

00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.329
and that will protect me
if the British should win.

Aye, it should be a

Maybe so, but they're no ready

teach that on the march.

to beat an army like that.
