00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:05.596
Previously...

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:06.997
May I introduce Alexander Randall,

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:09.884
the younger brother of
Captain Jonathan Randall.

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:12.725
Well, didn't I see you talking
to Mary Hawkins earlier?

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.727
You know her? Enchanting girl.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.529
You are unwell, Alex.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.598
It's not the future that Mary
has envisioned for herself.

00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:20.533
You should set aside your feelings.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.301
Mary Hawkins
and Jonathan Randall

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:24.003
were to have a child together.

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:26.739
Alex and Mary simply could
not be for Frank's sake.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.675
If we do not send men to fight,

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.043
this rebellion will melt away.

00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:33.279
Dougal. Colum
change his mind then?

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.582
Colum's mind is his own.
It's no concern of mine.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.450
We sail from France to fight a war.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.285
Let us fight.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.454
Turns out you were
right about Prestonpans.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.590
That means I'm also right
about the disaster

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.291
awaiting us at Culloden.

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:46.726
My Laird, is it true?
Are we turning back?

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:49.328
Aye, we're going back across the border.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.330
Home.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.575
_

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.568
- Aye, aye.
- Yeah.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.507
Where are we?

00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:42.542
Just outside Inverness.

00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:43.743
Is that good?

00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:45.845
We can rest here at least.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:49.749
Very well. You look
as if you need to sleep.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.925
Adam! Smiths!

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.905
It was hard to believe
that these were the same

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.609
brave Highland warriors who
had beaten the British army

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.712
at Prestonpans and Falkirk,

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:23.482
who had marched
triumphantly into England.

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.986
Five months of retreat with not
enough food and brutal weather

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:30.790
had left them broken and demoralized.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.528
Our worst nightmare was coming true,

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:38.998
and I felt completely
helpless in the face of it.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.007
Hey, take yer filthy hands off me.

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.842
Say this for ye, Rupert,

00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:53.045
losing an eye hasna improved
yer disposition any.

00:03:56.683 --> 00:04:00.086
Well, what good is a rebellion
that runs from a fight?

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:03.756
Ken what poor Angus would say?

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:06.726
The same as poor Kincaid, I expect.

00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:11.664
"It's time we turned...
showed them our faces."

00:04:11.764 --> 00:04:13.800
Eh.

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:31.618
Dougal...

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:33.519
I ken yer men crave sleep,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.622
but I need you to take a patrol out,

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:36.889
locate the enemy.

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:38.691
Find out how close behind us they are.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:40.827
The horses'll need feeding
afore we set out.

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:42.929
Aye. Take whatever we have left,

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:45.097
but find the British army for us.

00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:47.667
See that there's food
here when we return.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:51.170
The men's strength is
dwindling on a bannock a day.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.781
Murtagh, Lord George will be

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:05.151
calling a war council shortly.

00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.887
I need ye to ride to
Inverness, fetch the prince.

00:05:07.987 --> 00:05:10.557
Ye'll find him at Thunderton
House, Batchen Lane.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.822
A war council, eh?

00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:16.826
I think we three ken
where that will lead.

00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:21.531
Culloden Moor lies but a
few miles east of here.

00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.501
16th of April, ye said.

00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:25.969
That's when history records the battle.

00:05:30.474 --> 00:05:32.375
Three days from now.

00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:44.454
All that work,

00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:47.691
all that plotting,

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:52.662
how the bloody hell did we end up here?

00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:55.565
As ye say, Sassenach,

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:59.469
it wasna from lack of trying.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.838
But dinna wave the white flag just yet.

00:06:01.938 --> 00:06:06.810
There's still time to avoid
the fight we canna win,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.147
if I can make Charles see reason.

00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:13.517
I must see to the welfare of the men.

00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:18.187
Hopefully there's something to
eat in this Godforsaken place.

00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:21.491
I'll need to go into Inverness,

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:26.429
see if I can replenish
my medical supplies.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.564
I won't be long.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:51.487
Ginger, chamomile, and arsenic.

00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:53.523
Will there be anything else, Miss?

00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:55.058
A bottle of laudanum.

00:06:55.158 --> 00:06:57.927
That's the second
bottle this week, Miss.

00:06:58.027 --> 00:06:59.863
It's a very strong medicine.

00:06:59.963 --> 00:07:03.733
A bottle of laudanum. Please.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.635
Mary?

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:08.538
Claire.

00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:10.674
What on earth are you doing here?

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.543
I assume you've come
with the Jacobite army.

00:07:13.643 --> 00:07:15.945
Everyone seems to think
there'll be fighting soon.

00:07:16.045 --> 00:07:18.982
Yes, that may be true.

00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:20.617
But why are you here?

00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:22.919
We sent you home after what
happened with the duke.

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:24.721
Yes.

00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:27.591
And then Alex contacted me.

00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:29.058
You heard me correctly,

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:31.628
I am here with Alex Randall.

00:07:31.728 --> 00:07:33.630
He got a position assisting the overseer

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.965
of a large English
estate near Inverness.

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:38.702
And I decided to join him.

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:41.705
Alex and I are to be married.

00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:44.841
That's wonderful.

00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:46.542
Is it?

00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:48.011
You pretended to be my friend.

00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.779
I am your friend.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.047
Alex told me how you convinced him

00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:54.584
that leaving me in Paris
was in my best interest.

00:07:54.684 --> 00:07:56.786
He was in very poor health.

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:59.122
And he had no prospects
for employment; I...

00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:01.090
Here's your laudanum, Miss.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.192
Thank you.

00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:08.297
Mary.

00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:10.600
I'm sorry...

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.036
for any pain that I caused you or Alex.

00:08:13.136 --> 00:08:14.671
I shouldn't have interfered.

00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:17.106
The situation, it was...

00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:20.744
it was complicated.

00:08:20.844 --> 00:08:23.046
Is Alex all right?

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:25.615
He's going to be fine.

00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:27.617
I'm taking care of him now.

00:08:27.717 --> 00:08:29.052
Our landlady has a sickly child,

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:31.621
and she's been advising
me on proper medicines.

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.724
I see.

00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:36.793
Perhaps I could stop by?

00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:41.097
To see Alex and to apologize.

00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:43.733
If you wish.

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.202
We've taken a room at
McGilvrey's boarding house.

00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:09.592
Gentlemen, I have studied
our situation carefully,

00:09:09.693 --> 00:09:11.360
and our choice is clear:

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.597
the best spot to join
battle with the enemy

00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:17.867
is mere miles from where we now stand.

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:20.636
Culloden Moor.

00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:23.740
- Are we agreed?
- Aye.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.810
That is the perfect spot...

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.978
for the British.

00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:30.780
With that, I do agree.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.884
Culloden Moor is flat,
plain ground, sir.

00:09:34.984 --> 00:09:37.120
Without sufficient
cavalry and artillery,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.988
our lines will be smashed to pieces

00:09:39.088 --> 00:09:40.824
before our troops can
even engage the enemy.

00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:42.826
Aye, Clan Fraser, perhaps.

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:44.894
But the MacDonalds
will get the job done.

00:09:44.994 --> 00:09:46.896
Aye, and the Camerons.

00:09:46.996 --> 00:09:49.165
With all due respect,

00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:51.234
why fight at all?

00:09:54.971 --> 00:09:58.791
I implore you, Your Royal Highness,

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.635
walk the camp.

00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:01.903
See for yourself

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:05.039
the poor state of your army.

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:09.043
The men are too exhausted
to fight a major battle.

00:10:09.143 --> 00:10:12.046
I refuse to listen to any
more of this coward's talk!

00:10:12.146 --> 00:10:15.683
Enough.

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:20.688
There is still the matter
of the French gold.

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:23.858
A large shipment, you may recall,

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.795
supposedly sailed from the continent.

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:32.066
With such funds, we can
secure food and weapons.

00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.001
While we wait for its arrival,

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.604
we split the army into smaller units,

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:39.040
making it more difficult
for the British to follow.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.809
Then, when our men are well rested

00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:43.678
and have the supplies they need,

00:10:43.778 --> 00:10:47.815
we choose the better ground

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:49.951
to fight upon

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:53.154
and defeat our enemy once and for all.

00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:03.230
James...

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.834
you are my most loyal
companion and friend.

00:11:15.977 --> 00:11:18.813
But I am not some frightened hare

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:22.984
to be run down by a
pack of British hounds.

00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:24.952
I am a man.

00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:27.822
And I am a soldier.

00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:31.158
And I shall comport myself as one.

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:38.165
I'm weary of retreat.

00:11:45.707 --> 00:11:46.841
The men will rest,

00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:50.812
and then we shall march to Culloden.

00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:53.748
Gentlemen,

00:11:53.848 --> 00:11:56.951
God will provide for us.

00:11:57.051 --> 00:12:00.287
We do His bidding.

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.224
May He have mercy on us all.

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:34.756
I've dissolved some more
arsenic in this tea.

00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:37.158
Mary, arsenic will bring
color to his cheeks,

00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:38.659
but it won't help his cough.

00:12:46.367 --> 00:12:49.170
Madame Fraser.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.073
How good it is to see you.

00:12:52.173 --> 00:12:53.340
And you, Alex.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.010
Save your breath.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.080
She's right.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.248
I'll prepare a poultice

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:03.350
to ease the muscles on
your chest and back.

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:14.695
Johnny.

00:13:14.796 --> 00:13:18.099
You remember Madame Fraser.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.806
You said nothing
about another visit

00:13:24.906 --> 00:13:26.207
in your last letter.

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:29.143
And where is your uniform?

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:32.313
I was granted leave to see you.

00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:36.250
I didn't want to attract attention.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.319
So good to see you, Johnny.

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:54.802
You're not leaving, are you?

00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:57.004
I don't know what would have
become of us without John.

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:58.772
What do you mean?

00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:00.975
Alex has been unable to work for weeks.

00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:02.409
We would be completely destitute

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.412
if it wasn't for John paying our bills.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:10.017
When do you think he'll be able
to get back to work again?

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:13.087
Mary...

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.222
I think you need to start

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:18.392
making reparations with your family

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:20.094
so you have somewhere to go when Alex...

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:23.797
When Alex what?

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:27.034
He won't be going back to work.

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:30.237
He can't be cured. I'm sorry.

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:32.339
Bu... but he must be cured.

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:42.216
Oh, God, Mary,

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:46.153
are you pregnant?

00:14:46.253 --> 00:14:48.055
Does Alex know?

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.924
Yes.

00:14:50.024 --> 00:14:52.093
- And John.
- Mary.

00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:00.001
Alex is asking for you.

00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:18.986
Madame Fraser.

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:22.990
Claire.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.960
Do not take your animus
for me out on my brother.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.363
Alex has not drawn an
easy breath in weeks.

00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:32.967
His youth and vigor are
drowning in blood and phlegm.

00:15:33.067 --> 00:15:34.135
Cure him.

00:15:34.235 --> 00:15:36.103
As I've explained to Mary,

00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:39.173
I cannot help him.

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:41.342
What are you saying?

00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:43.444
Alex can't be cured.

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:50.384
But you can ease his pain.

00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:58.392
I do not ask for myself.

00:15:58.492 --> 00:16:02.129
I ask for my brother and Mary

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.464
and their unborn child.

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:12.206
If I am to attend your brother,

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:15.309
then I want something in exchange.

00:16:17.979 --> 00:16:21.248
You will tell me where
Cumberland's army is.

00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:23.917
My.

00:16:24.018 --> 00:16:27.488
You would barter over an
innocent man's suffering?

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:31.425
Madame Fraser, you impress me.

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:34.361
The woman I am now is not
the woman I once was,

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.130
Captain Randall.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.432
Hmm.

00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:41.302
We'll never rid
ourselves of that man.

00:16:41.402 --> 00:16:43.404
But perhaps this time,
his presence in our life

00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.306
- will be good for us.
- Nairn.

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:47.374
Are you sure that's what Randall said?

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:50.144
That Cumberland's army
is encamped at Nairn?

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:52.213
Yes.

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:56.550
That's only 12 miles from here.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.485
And he said that two nights from now,

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.222
there'll be a celebration for
Cumberland's birthday there.

00:17:06.127 --> 00:17:11.032
Well, that's very interesting
information indeed, Sassenach,

00:17:11.132 --> 00:17:12.399
if it's true.

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.468
I actually believe him.

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:18.072
Normally, I wouldn't, but
he seemed desperate.

00:17:18.172 --> 00:17:20.074
And we could confirm it, couldn't we?

00:17:20.174 --> 00:17:21.608
Aye.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.677
Aye.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.315
I want to go back and tend to Alex.

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:30.084
I know it's a small act

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:31.985
in light of everything
we're facing here,

00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:33.487
but I believe I owe Mary that much.

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:35.422
And what if Alex dies in your care?

00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:37.091
Huh?

00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:39.426
What's to stop that evil
bastard brother of his

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:41.295
sending you into the
next world after him?

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.197
Murtagh could go with me.

00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:14.161
Here, on yer feet, ye lazy swine.

00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.396
What?

00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:16.630
Would ye be so kind as to tell me

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.632
what the MacKenzie's doing here?

00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:22.103
If I knew, I would.

00:19:01.275 --> 00:19:05.712
It's good to see some familiar faces.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.583
I was sorry to hear about Angus' death.

00:19:09.683 --> 00:19:12.453
I always thought when
that wee bastard fell,

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:16.157
that you would fall with him.

00:19:16.257 --> 00:19:18.325
So did I.

00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:32.639
Well, how long am I to stand here

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:36.277
on these rickety sticks of mine?

00:19:36.377 --> 00:19:40.214
Find me a bed to rest on.

00:19:40.314 --> 00:19:43.484
Bring me my brother and my nephew.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.235
Ye're wasting yer time

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:06.240
with all this prodding and poking.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.575
The healer who took your place at Leoch,

00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:13.514
he's been looking more and more
dour these past few weeks.

00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:16.317
With good reason, I'm afraid.

00:20:16.417 --> 00:20:18.652
I've been dying for years.

00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:22.589
It's a wearisome process.

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:25.326
I welcome its conclusion.

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:30.264
Is that why ye travelled all this way,

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:32.333
in yer weakened condition?

00:20:34.968 --> 00:20:38.272
To hurry your death along?

00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:42.376
It would appear my brother
still gets satisfaction

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:43.810
from keeping me waiting.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.713
Dougal isna in camp at present.

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:49.483
He's leading a scout.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.491
I always said ye were a smart lad.

00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:00.794
Give my brother enough authority

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:03.730
to keep him content,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.599
but not enough to allow him

00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:09.236
to grab for more.

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:11.338
It's as if ye read my mind.

00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:21.582
While we await his return,

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:24.985
I shall speak with Claire in private.

00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:32.726
I'll be close by,

00:21:32.826 --> 00:21:34.828
if needed.

00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:43.904
Here.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:51.445
My good lad.

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:55.849
I commend ye on such an
admirable marriage, Claire.

00:21:58.652 --> 00:22:02.889
I remember a time when you found
our union less agreeable.

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:06.760
I was wrong.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.764
That's one of the pleasures of dying.

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:15.536
I can finally admit my mistakes.

00:22:15.636 --> 00:22:16.737
It also makes it easier

00:22:16.837 --> 00:22:21.308
to ask for favors.

00:22:21.408 --> 00:22:23.877
And I need one from you, Claire.

00:22:26.713 --> 00:22:28.915
My pain,

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.952
it grows more tedious by the day.

00:22:32.052 --> 00:22:33.787
I'm sorry.

00:22:33.887 --> 00:22:35.456
I'll get you some laudanum.

00:22:35.556 --> 00:22:38.559
Laudanum, no, no.

00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:41.862
Laudanum just dulls the senses.

00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:48.635
I would prefer something more final.

00:23:07.688 --> 00:23:11.425
Isn't suicide a sin?

00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:13.994
What's one more sin to a sinner?

00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:22.736
Geillis Duncan gave her
husband a quick death.

00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:26.573
I would welcome the same.

00:23:26.673 --> 00:23:29.910
It may have been quick,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.914
but death by cyanide poisoning

00:23:34.014 --> 00:23:37.484
is an agonizing way to end one's life.

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:40.687
I leave the details to you.

00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:43.990
I trust that you will
give me a kinder death

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.393
than that bitch gave poor Arthur.

00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:49.062
Do not speak ill of my friend Geillis.

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:56.970
Memories...

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.707
they remain raw even longer than wounds.

00:24:03.644 --> 00:24:07.981
But I have a piece of
news to ease yer mind.

00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:10.517
Geillis' bairn lives.

00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:16.022
How?

00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:18.792
Geillis wasn't burned until
after the bairn was born.

00:24:23.597 --> 00:24:27.000
A boy.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.635
Where is he now?

00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:31.572
He's with William MacKenzie and Sarah.

00:24:31.672 --> 00:24:35.942
They have no children of their own.

00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:39.045
Does Dougal know?

00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:41.682
I've never heard him mention the child.

00:24:41.782 --> 00:24:44.785
The boy is but one more mistake

00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:47.788
my brother has to live with.

00:25:21.788 --> 00:25:24.991
This is yellow jasmine.

00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:29.029
It will be like drifting
off into a deep sleep.

00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:36.570
For when you're ready.

00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.981
For what it's worth,

00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:51.952
y-you have my deepest gratitude.

00:25:58.258 --> 00:25:59.993
Breathe. Shh.

00:26:02.696 --> 00:26:04.731
- Shh.
- What are you doing?

00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:06.600
Mary, light a taper.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.668
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:26:07.768 --> 00:26:09.870
Alex.

00:26:15.942 --> 00:26:17.578
He can't smoke that.

00:26:17.678 --> 00:26:19.079
It's a mixture of
coltsfoot and thornapple.

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:21.081
- It will help open his airway.
- He can barely breathe.

00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:23.750
This will help him breathe.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.819
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.921
- Mary, I need you to hold this.
- No. No, no.

00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:32.058
Please.

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:33.960
Hold this up to his face.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.630
Cover both his nose and his mouth.

00:26:39.866 --> 00:26:41.768
That's it.

00:26:44.137 --> 00:26:45.972
Okay, breathe it in. Breathe it in.

00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:47.874
Breathe deeply.

00:26:47.974 --> 00:26:52.746
That's it. One more time.

00:26:52.846 --> 00:26:53.980
Slowly, Alex.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.750
Shh.

00:26:59.853 --> 00:27:03.023
- Inhale.
- Breathe it deeply.

00:27:03.123 --> 00:27:05.158
- Okay, one more.
- Deep and slow, shh.

00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:12.833
Deep and slow.

00:27:12.933 --> 00:27:15.068
That's it.

00:27:19.973 --> 00:27:21.975
Shh.

00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:31.017
It's all right.

00:27:31.117 --> 00:27:33.019
Mary.

00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:41.094
You're okay.

00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.633
Here you go.

00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:49.069
There.

00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:51.905
There, there.

00:27:52.005 --> 00:27:54.007
Madame Fraser.

00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:03.016
It's all right.

00:28:03.116 --> 00:28:05.986
He's in pain.

00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:09.255
Yes, I know.

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:10.891
Perhaps a bit more arsenic.

00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:12.058
No more arsenic.

00:28:12.158 --> 00:28:14.661
It won't do any good.

00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:17.097
Laudanum if he needs to sleep.

00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:22.736
But there's nothing more I can do.

00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:24.838
I'm sorry.

00:28:26.973 --> 00:28:29.009
Sorry? We had an agreement.

00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:30.811
You said you would help him.

00:28:30.911 --> 00:28:33.013
I am helping to ease his pain,

00:28:33.113 --> 00:28:34.280
but I can't cure him.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.750
If ye need to vent yer frustration,

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.918
then I'll happily oblige ye.

00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:41.021
Stop it, both of you.

00:28:41.121 --> 00:28:45.992
Johnny.

00:28:46.092 --> 00:28:48.061
Johnny.

00:28:57.437 --> 00:29:01.107
Alex, what is it?

00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:04.410
I must ask you to do something for me,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.048
for us.

00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:09.750
Anything.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.319
Know that I do not ask this lightly,

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.221
but for the sake of your love for me...

00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:17.858
Shh.

00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:21.762
Alex, I won't let Mary or the
child want for anything.

00:29:21.862 --> 00:29:24.998
You know that.

00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:25.999
Thank you.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.806
I've sent for the minister.

00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:34.975
The minister?

00:29:35.075 --> 00:29:38.011
No, no, the last rites,

00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:41.915
not just yet.

00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:45.018
For your wedding.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.356
My wedding?

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:55.028
You and Mary, dear brother.

00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:03.303
I need you to
look after her, Johnny.

00:30:05.405 --> 00:30:07.908
We want...

00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:11.277
our child to have the Randall name.

00:30:11.377 --> 00:30:14.314
Alex, you can do that by
marrying her yourself.

00:30:14.414 --> 00:30:17.217
Of course, I will see that
she is taken care of.

00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:19.252
As her... her husband,

00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:21.254
you can give Mary and our child

00:30:21.354 --> 00:30:25.325
some position in the world,

00:30:25.425 --> 00:30:27.260
so much more than I could.

00:30:33.499 --> 00:30:36.269
I commend the well being

00:30:36.369 --> 00:30:40.406
of those most precious to me...

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:43.009
to the one I have loved the longest.

00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:06.232
You think I am unaware of the
density of the dark wall

00:31:06.332 --> 00:31:08.368
you have built to protect
your better self

00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:12.005
from the world?

00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:16.042
But I have borne witness
to your tenderness.

00:31:16.142 --> 00:31:20.446
I've been the beneficiary
of your generous soul.

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:23.183
That inner man is the one

00:31:23.283 --> 00:31:27.120
whom I entrust my love...

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.122
and my child.

00:31:34.294 --> 00:31:36.262
I'm sorry.

00:31:38.364 --> 00:31:40.400
I'm sorry.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.202
Captain Randall.

00:31:42.302 --> 00:31:43.336
Where the hell are ye going?

00:31:43.436 --> 00:31:45.138
Claire, please!

00:31:45.238 --> 00:31:46.973
Go after him. I need to speak with him.

00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:48.041
Please.

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:49.509
Coming.

00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:53.379
Hold it up to his face again.

00:31:56.482 --> 00:31:58.151
One more time, breathe.

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:03.589
Dougal, what news?

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:06.993
The British are camped at Nairn.

00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:09.062
- So I've been told.
- Oh, have ye?

00:32:09.162 --> 00:32:10.430
I wish ye could have been told

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.198
before I did all that hard riding.

00:32:12.298 --> 00:32:15.035
I understand the British are
planning to throw a party

00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:17.337
in celebration of
Cumberland's 25th birthday.

00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:19.205
Well, we saw no such preparations.

00:32:19.305 --> 00:32:20.406
Where did ye get the information?

00:32:20.506 --> 00:32:24.244
Given to Claire by a British officer.

00:32:24.344 --> 00:32:26.512
Jonathan Wolverton Randall.

00:32:26.612 --> 00:32:28.548
Black Jack Randall?

00:32:28.648 --> 00:32:31.317
Well, there's a tale behind
that meeting, to be sure.

00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:33.519
And we're not giving that
bastard's word credence?

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:36.522
No, not on its own.

00:32:36.622 --> 00:32:38.458
I've sent scouts to Inverness.

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:41.461
It seems British commissary
officers have been seen

00:32:41.561 --> 00:32:43.529
purchasing wine and sweet meats.

00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:45.198
Food and drink is all
I've been thinking about

00:32:45.298 --> 00:32:47.300
on the ride back.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.504
What's this?

00:32:51.604 --> 00:32:54.074
There's little sustenance
here, I'm afraid.

00:32:54.174 --> 00:32:56.176
You'll have to postpone
partaking even in that.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:57.410
Why?

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.146
My belly's crying out to be fed.

00:33:00.246 --> 00:33:02.415
Colum has arrived.

00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.489
I canna believe yer
encouraging this madness,

00:33:09.589 --> 00:33:12.058
all to save goddamned Frank Randall.

00:33:12.158 --> 00:33:13.659
Hasn't enough suffering been had

00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:16.296
in the name of saving
that mythical prick?

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:19.165
Frank is neither a myth nor a prick.

00:33:19.265 --> 00:33:21.501
Oh, well, by all means, then,

00:33:21.601 --> 00:33:24.170
let us hand over the
lamb to be a plaything

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.372
for that twisted, black-hearted wolf.

00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:29.075
Look, I realize it may
seem like I've made a deal

00:33:29.175 --> 00:33:30.443
with the devil himself,

00:33:30.543 --> 00:33:32.578
but Mary Hawkins needs a husband.

00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:35.248
Otherwise she and the child
will be starving on the streets

00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:39.085
and destitute.

00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:41.187
Then I will marry her.

00:33:43.289 --> 00:33:47.527
Hmm. Hmm.

00:33:47.627 --> 00:33:51.331
She's not the sort of woman
I'd ever imagine fer myself,

00:33:51.431 --> 00:33:55.335
not that I spend much
time doing that, mind ye.

00:33:55.435 --> 00:33:58.204
And I'm hardly the kind she fancies,

00:33:58.304 --> 00:34:01.707
if that soft lump Alex
Randall is any indication.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:06.146
But we could learn to get along.

00:34:06.246 --> 00:34:08.148
Hmm.

00:34:08.248 --> 00:34:11.317
People do.

00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:13.386
I've never been a father,

00:34:13.486 --> 00:34:16.189
but Jamie's parents,

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:19.259
they chose me to be his godfather,

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:21.261
and I've watched over him.

00:34:22.428 --> 00:34:26.666
He didn't turn out too badly.

00:34:26.766 --> 00:34:30.503
You've been a wonderful
godfather to him.

00:34:30.603 --> 00:34:33.573
Mary and the baby would
be lucky to have you.

00:34:33.673 --> 00:34:35.541
But?

00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:38.278
We're at war.

00:34:38.378 --> 00:34:42.415
You could end up dead
tomorrow or the next day,

00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:45.518
and then where would they be?

00:34:45.618 --> 00:34:48.654
Captain Randall could share
the same fate, God willing.

00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:51.324
Yes, but as Randall's widow,

00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:52.625
she'd be entitled to his property

00:34:52.725 --> 00:34:54.327
and his officer's pension.

00:34:54.427 --> 00:34:56.562
Plus he has a family
pedigree and a station

00:34:56.662 --> 00:34:58.598
that her father might
find acceptable enough

00:34:58.698 --> 00:35:00.533
to let her come home.

00:35:00.633 --> 00:35:03.203
More acceptable than a
broken down Highlander

00:35:03.303 --> 00:35:07.340
with no home and no two
sticks to rub together, eh?

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.243
I'm sorry to say, but yes.

00:35:10.343 --> 00:35:13.546
Aye.

00:35:13.646 --> 00:35:15.381
This is the place.

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:18.351
Well, wait here.

00:35:18.451 --> 00:35:21.354
I feel it might go
better if I went alone.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.808
Mmm.

00:36:03.396 --> 00:36:05.064
What kind of God creates a world

00:36:05.165 --> 00:36:08.701
where monsters thrive,

00:36:08.801 --> 00:36:10.470
beauty and purity is rewarded

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:15.275
with poverty and death?

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:19.612
The same God that also offers
an opportunity for redemption.

00:36:19.712 --> 00:36:21.314
Hmm.

00:36:24.717 --> 00:36:26.352
You have to help me

00:36:26.452 --> 00:36:30.290
persuade him to give this up.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.558
Alex must marry the girl himself,

00:36:32.658 --> 00:36:35.695
give the child a father and a name.

00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:37.697
I will see that she is
taken care of, but I...

00:36:37.797 --> 00:36:41.434
And what happens to Mary when
you're not alive to do that?

00:36:45.438 --> 00:36:47.407
Hmm.

00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:52.512
Your curse.

00:36:52.612 --> 00:36:57.517
April 16th, 1746.

00:36:57.617 --> 00:36:59.519
Yes.

00:36:59.619 --> 00:37:03.323
The date of your death.

00:37:03.423 --> 00:37:07.460
Merely days away.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.363
And as your sister-in-law,
Mary is entitled to nothing,

00:37:10.463 --> 00:37:11.531
but as your widow...

00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:13.766
What if your curse proves untrue

00:37:13.866 --> 00:37:16.702
and the world continues
as it always has?

00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:19.805
The pure of heart choking to
death on their own blood,

00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.608
helped there, perhaps,

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:29.482
by the monsters that walk among them.

00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:31.384
Have you ever harmed your brother?

00:37:31.484 --> 00:37:34.420
Never.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.889
Perhaps that immunity will also extend

00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:38.691
to those he holds most dear.

00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:42.862
Mm, perhaps.

00:37:42.962 --> 00:37:46.766
Is that good enough for you?

00:37:46.866 --> 00:37:48.934
Sometimes that's all we get.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.447
Did he never tell you

00:38:01.547 --> 00:38:03.916
the things I did to him in that room?

00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:13.259
Yes.

00:38:16.962 --> 00:38:19.465
I know the sound he makes at the last,

00:38:19.565 --> 00:38:21.601
when he has lost himself.

00:38:26.005 --> 00:38:30.743
And I regret none of it.

00:38:30.843 --> 00:38:33.479
The pain,

00:38:33.579 --> 00:38:36.816
fear,

00:38:36.916 --> 00:38:40.753
I revel in it.

00:38:40.853 --> 00:38:43.889
Do you really want Mary in my bed?

00:38:46.326 --> 00:38:50.930
Help me...

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.766
persuade my brother to give this up.

00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:04.944
Alex will not listen to me.

00:39:05.044 --> 00:39:08.448
But you are sending your brother

00:39:08.548 --> 00:39:12.452
to his grave with a broken heart.

00:39:12.552 --> 00:39:14.587
If you love Alex,

00:39:14.687 --> 00:39:17.757
then I trust that that love is enough

00:39:17.857 --> 00:39:20.660
to stay your impulses with Mary.

00:39:34.674 --> 00:39:37.710
It grieves me to see
you so ill, brother.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.647
Congratulations on yer
ability to hide it so well.

00:39:41.747 --> 00:39:45.951
If so, it is because I also feel
joy at yer change of heart.

00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:48.287
What change would that be?

00:39:48.388 --> 00:39:50.289
Joining the MacKenzies of Leoch

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.891
with our righteous rebellion,

00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:55.561
restoring the king across
the water to his throne.

00:39:57.663 --> 00:40:00.866
You think I've turned Jacobite?

00:40:00.966 --> 00:40:03.869
That I'm going to lead the
MacKenzies over the cliff,

00:40:03.969 --> 00:40:06.005
with you lot?

00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:09.609
Well, I may be dying,

00:40:09.709 --> 00:40:12.745
but I have not turned simple.

00:40:12.845 --> 00:40:14.847
If you didn't come to aid us,

00:40:14.947 --> 00:40:16.348
then why come at all?

00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:19.318
There are matters, clan matters,

00:40:19.419 --> 00:40:23.355
that must be resolved while
I can still draw breath.

00:40:33.098 --> 00:40:36.101
I have declared my wish

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:38.037
that my son Hamish

00:40:38.137 --> 00:40:42.074
be the next chief of Clan MacKenzie.

00:40:42.174 --> 00:40:44.977
Hamish is but a lad.

00:40:45.077 --> 00:40:47.813
Who will guide the clan
till he comes of age,

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:50.883
teach him what it means to be chief?

00:40:50.983 --> 00:40:54.620
Ned Gowan can instruct him in clan law.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.789
And I have chosen a guardian,

00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:59.959
somebody I believe the clan will follow

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:02.862
until Hamish comes of age,

00:41:02.962 --> 00:41:05.397
a man whose task it will be

00:41:05.498 --> 00:41:08.434
to guide the boy into manhood...

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.372
To see that he learns

00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:15.875
how to choose what's best

00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:19.712
for the future of the clan

00:41:19.812 --> 00:41:24.416
and to thus demonstrate his
worthiness to be chief.

00:41:29.522 --> 00:41:31.156
James Fraser,

00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:35.661
I offer you this guardianship.

00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:38.798
You choose a Fraser over a
MacKenzie to lead the clan?

00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:42.802
Over your own brother?

00:41:42.902 --> 00:41:45.971
Deny me the boy's
guardianship, when by rights,

00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:47.707
you should be proposing me as successor?

00:41:47.807 --> 00:41:49.074
Jamie is our sister's son.

00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:50.442
Ach, away.

00:41:50.543 --> 00:41:52.945
He shares our blood, and you know it.

00:41:53.045 --> 00:41:57.182
Besides, uh, I am
skeptical that my support

00:41:57.282 --> 00:42:00.119
would be enough to convince the clan

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:03.422
to choose you as their chief.

00:42:03.523 --> 00:42:07.493
Do ye not think the MacKenzies
would follow my leadership?

00:42:07.593 --> 00:42:11.797
Brother, if you were half as popular

00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:15.100
as you believe yerself to be,

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.838
then there would be more men here today

00:42:18.938 --> 00:42:21.941
in this army of yours.

00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:24.109
Has that thought ever crossed your mind?

00:42:24.209 --> 00:42:27.446
Christ's bloody cross!

00:42:27.547 --> 00:42:29.114
I love Hamish,

00:42:29.214 --> 00:42:31.050
and he is considerably fond of me.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.918
He barely even knows Jamie.

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:36.989
He's your spawn, as you are
very fond of reminding me,

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:40.125
and I ken the deep affection
ye hold fer the boy.

00:42:40.225 --> 00:42:41.927
And I ken the real reason

00:42:42.027 --> 00:42:44.964
behind this loathsome decision of yours.

00:42:45.064 --> 00:42:46.832
It's your last chance to punish me

00:42:46.932 --> 00:42:48.901
for fathering the son
that you never could.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:55.741
I do not have the strength
to pick at old wounds.

00:42:55.841 --> 00:42:58.744
It is the future of the clan

00:42:58.844 --> 00:43:02.147
that holds sway over my thoughts,

00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:06.485
and I will do all I can
to ensure that future.

00:43:06.586 --> 00:43:09.154
And what future would that be?

00:43:09.254 --> 00:43:11.991
Do you honestly think

00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:15.928
that Jamie will do anything
different from me?

00:43:16.028 --> 00:43:18.864
When you close yer eyes
for the final time,

00:43:18.964 --> 00:43:21.533
he will rally the
MacKenzies to our cause,

00:43:21.634 --> 00:43:25.104
and they will fight and die fer it.

00:43:25.204 --> 00:43:27.973
And damn your wishes.

00:43:31.176 --> 00:43:33.045
I'm honored...

00:43:33.145 --> 00:43:35.948
to be entrusted with
the care of yer son.

00:43:41.053 --> 00:43:43.923
But Dougal speaks true.

00:43:44.023 --> 00:43:46.959
I will use every option in my power

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:49.094
to defeat the British,

00:43:49.194 --> 00:43:52.965
and that includes raising
the MacKenzie banner.

00:43:56.201 --> 00:43:59.839
I do not doubt yer fighting spirit,

00:43:59.939 --> 00:44:03.075
but I know that you will not

00:44:03.175 --> 00:44:06.879
sacrifice your men needlessly.

00:44:06.979 --> 00:44:11.050
If the cause is lost,

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:15.220
then you will put the lives
of yer men above all else.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.839
You tell me that you would do the same.

00:44:33.939 --> 00:44:35.875
Say the words...

00:44:35.975 --> 00:44:37.176
meaning them,

00:44:37.276 --> 00:44:40.245
in yer head and in yer heart,

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:43.115
and the guardianship is yers.

00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:04.970
My poor brother.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:09.008
I have lived my life crippled in body,

00:45:09.108 --> 00:45:13.612
and he has lived his crippled in mind.

00:45:16.015 --> 00:45:17.950
In sickness and in health,

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.152
forsaking all others,
be faithful unto her

00:45:20.252 --> 00:45:21.386
as long as you both shall live?

00:45:33.298 --> 00:45:35.134
I will.

00:45:35.234 --> 00:45:37.302
Miryam,
will you take this man

00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:39.038
to be your husband,

00:45:39.138 --> 00:45:42.141
to live together forever in
the covenant of marriage?

00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:45.177
Will you love him, comfort
him, honor, and keep him

00:45:45.277 --> 00:45:47.379
in sickness and in health,
forsaking all others,

00:45:47.479 --> 00:45:50.983
be faithful unto him as long
as you both shall live?

00:45:56.288 --> 00:45:58.357
It's all right.

00:46:04.329 --> 00:46:08.133
I will.

00:46:12.371 --> 00:46:14.940
Will those of you
witnessing these promises

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.909
do all in your power
to uphold the marriage

00:46:17.009 --> 00:46:21.013
of these two people?

00:46:21.113 --> 00:46:22.347
We will.

00:46:24.817 --> 00:46:28.220
Aye, I will. Get on with it.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.690
O gracious and everlasting God,

00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:33.993
look mercifully upon
this man and this woman,

00:46:34.093 --> 00:46:37.162
who come to you seeking your blessing...

00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:45.137
A surprise attack?

00:46:45.237 --> 00:46:48.407
During Cumberland's
birthday festivities?

00:46:48.507 --> 00:46:50.242
I guarantee

00:46:50.342 --> 00:46:52.411
it will prove a birthday
he'll not soon forget.

00:46:53.879 --> 00:46:56.448
A birthday and a burial

00:46:56.548 --> 00:46:58.250
on the very same day.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.252
That will be worth celebrating.

00:47:00.352 --> 00:47:02.187
It doesn't sound very gentlemanly.

00:47:02.287 --> 00:47:05.157
I think we've all learned
there's nothing gentlemanly

00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:07.292
about waging war.

00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:10.495
It would mean a 12-mile march by night.

00:47:10.595 --> 00:47:13.999
And are the men capable of
such strenuous endeavor?

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:16.268
They've not let us down yet.

00:47:16.368 --> 00:47:20.039
Lord George will lead one column,

00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:21.740
I the other.

00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:25.177
Together we will trap
the British between us.

00:47:34.186 --> 00:47:35.387
John?

00:47:35.487 --> 00:47:37.823
John, I look to you, as always.

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:45.297
The plan has some merit, I'll admit.

00:47:45.397 --> 00:47:47.266
I will agree to it...

00:47:47.366 --> 00:47:49.434
on one condition.

00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:53.072
Fraser, you and the general
shall ride together.

00:47:53.172 --> 00:47:55.040
The prince and I shall
command the second column.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.441
I'm not sure that's very wise.

00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:58.077
We accept your conditions.

00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:05.350
Well, then, gentlemen, it's decided.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.452
Mark me...

00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:13.525
I shall bring my finest bottle of wine

00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:16.561
as a gift for Cumberland,

00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:21.033
and I shall present it to
him when he's my prisoner.

00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:25.437
It will be most amusing
to see his reaction.

00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.443
Very good, sir.

00:48:46.291 --> 00:48:48.260
Brought ye a wee drink.

00:48:52.932 --> 00:48:55.901
Will ye not leave me in peace?

00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:59.538
Ye reek of sour wine.

00:48:59.638 --> 00:49:03.108
Aye, I do.

00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:05.210
It's all that I could find.

00:49:07.312 --> 00:49:11.116
I've drunk enough to muddle a stallion,

00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:14.453
and yet I remain as sober as a bairn.

00:49:23.495 --> 00:49:28.400
Oh, well, it appears there
is none left to share.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.869
Oh, well.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.905
Perhaps it's for the best.

00:49:34.006 --> 00:49:36.475
God knows I have no
wish for you to think

00:49:36.575 --> 00:49:39.644
I would hasten your
leaving of this world.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.951
I am beyond any injury

00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:48.553
you could do to me.

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:51.623
"Injury I do you"?

00:49:59.764 --> 00:50:02.267
What about all the pain
you've put me through

00:50:02.367 --> 00:50:05.470
in this bitch of a life we've shared?

00:50:13.578 --> 00:50:17.516
Your life is your own.

00:50:17.616 --> 00:50:21.253
I take no blame for it.

00:50:21.353 --> 00:50:23.455
I still remember the day.

00:50:23.555 --> 00:50:26.525
You know, the...

00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:28.627
the day they brought ye back
after you'd been thrown

00:50:28.727 --> 00:50:31.596
by that horse.

00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:35.000
Was a stallion, I think.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.869
Too wild for a ten-year-old to ride.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.344
You were sorely injured, but...

00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:49.448
I knew you'd recover.

00:50:49.548 --> 00:50:51.250
You're my big brother.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:54.353
Nothing hurts you.

00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:59.391
Or so I believed.

00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:05.497
But you betrayed me, hmm?

00:51:07.699 --> 00:51:11.403
Instead of mending, ye got worse.

00:51:11.503 --> 00:51:15.674
And I watched ye every day,

00:51:15.774 --> 00:51:20.512
yer limbs getting more and more twisted.

00:51:20.612 --> 00:51:22.614
I watched you shrink.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.755
And I hated ye for it.

00:51:30.855 --> 00:51:34.526
And with that hate,

00:51:34.626 --> 00:51:36.628
I wept.

00:51:39.598 --> 00:51:43.034
I wept more than I ever
have before or since.

00:51:49.108 --> 00:51:53.412
The world was never the same again.

00:51:53.512 --> 00:51:55.514
You destroyed it.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.628
No response?

00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:17.502
Damn yer soul, answer me.

00:52:17.602 --> 00:52:21.039
Answer me.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.108
Brother?

00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:26.611
Brother?

00:52:56.308 --> 00:52:58.076
Oh, brother.

00:53:00.512 --> 00:53:04.283
So ye turn yer back on
me one final time, eh?

00:53:06.918 --> 00:53:11.156
And ye leave me alone in the dark...

00:53:11.256 --> 00:53:15.594
the darkness of the world.

00:53:15.694 --> 00:53:18.663
And all I hoped to say to you...

00:53:21.566 --> 00:53:24.102
It remains trapped in here.

00:53:30.575 --> 00:53:32.544
Right here.

00:53:34.746 --> 00:53:37.649
Unsaid.

00:53:37.749 --> 00:53:39.684
Forever.

00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:58.603
All because you couldn't keep
yer arse on a bloody horse.

00:55:50.882 --> 00:55:55.654
I can't believe you encouraged
that wee slip of a girl to...

00:55:55.754 --> 00:55:56.921
to become his wife.

00:55:57.021 --> 00:56:00.659
I encouraged her to become his widow.

00:56:00.759 --> 00:56:03.261
Black Jack will die tomorrow

00:56:03.362 --> 00:56:04.729
at the Battle of Culloden.

00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:05.897
But if we succeed tonight,

00:56:05.997 --> 00:56:07.699
there will be no battle.

00:56:07.799 --> 00:56:10.034
Then perhaps his death will
come about by some other means.

00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:11.603
And if it doesn't?

00:56:11.703 --> 00:56:13.304
Then I am prepared to keep my promise

00:56:13.405 --> 00:56:17.609
that I made to you in Paris.

00:56:17.709 --> 00:56:20.379
To help me...

00:56:20.479 --> 00:56:22.447
bleed him.

00:56:25.116 --> 00:56:28.853
Remind me not to get on
your bad side, Sassenach.

00:56:37.396 --> 00:56:39.297
You be careful.

00:57:22.073 --> 00:57:25.677
Well, where in God's name
is that imbecile Charles?

00:57:25.777 --> 00:57:28.880
Was supposed to be here hours ago.

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.750
Our army is spent.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:34.419
I fear we put too much
faith in starving men.

00:57:34.519 --> 00:57:36.020
I'd take a starving Highlander

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.922
over a drunken British soldier any day.

00:57:38.022 --> 00:57:39.090
Aye.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:40.892
We could attack it now

00:57:40.992 --> 00:57:42.927
and hope the prince's
men turn up in time.

00:57:43.027 --> 00:57:45.029
We have more chance here
than with what awaits us

00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:46.865
on Culloden Moor tomorrow.

00:57:51.836 --> 00:57:55.006
The prince and his
men, they turned back.

00:57:55.106 --> 00:57:57.141
They lost their way in the darkness.

00:57:57.241 --> 00:57:59.811
His troops are scattered
from here to kingdom come.

00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:01.379
Let me give the signal to attack.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.814
We're here.

00:58:02.914 --> 00:58:04.382
Oh, with only a portion of our force,

00:58:04.483 --> 00:58:05.917
it would be madness.

00:58:06.017 --> 00:58:07.819
And with the dawn, we'll lose
the element of surprise.

00:58:07.919 --> 00:58:09.954
- No.
- I have no choice

00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:12.791
but to call off the attack.

00:58:12.891 --> 00:58:14.626
We march the army back to Inverness.

00:58:16.957 --> 00:58:18.058
General!

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.665
Tomorrow the prince
will have his battle...

00:58:25.796 --> 00:58:28.233
On Culloden Moor.

00:58:31.911 --> 00:58:34.739
