00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.388
Previously...

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:14.307
She hexed Jamie and turned him
away from me.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.603
She put an ill-wish under my bed.
And then tried to seduce my husband!

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.109
Sire! This woman is a liar and a witch.

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:30.782
But La Dame Blanche is a white witch,
and I practice white magic.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.409
And with French money,
we will unite the clans,

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:36.704
and I will lead you all
to the gates of London.

00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:38.289
And to glory.

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:40.208
The prince is a canny, slippery man,

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.669
yet can fool good men to
believe he's God's chosen one.

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:44.504
We have thwarted him all we can.

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.423
We may find ourselves
staring into the abyss awaiting us

00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:48.925
at the bottom of Culloden Moor.

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:50.426
Bring me home.

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:52.345
- To Scotland.
- Aye.

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:55.306
Scotland.

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:40.870
We returned to heal in the peace
of the Scottish Highlands.

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.957
Jamie's sister, Jenny,
and her husband, Ian,

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.710
had had another baby
while we were in Paris.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:51.839
Their welcome and the daily
routines of Lallybroch

00:02:51.923 --> 00:02:54.550
worked like a tonic on our battered souls.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.264
We hoped we had done enough
to stop the war.

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.768
We began planning our future,

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.687
but as a very prescient Scot
once observed,

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:09.273
"the best laid schemes of mice and men."

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:11.984
Claire, Claire! They're ready!

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:13.903
Look how big they are!

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.363
They're giant!

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.949
Oh, my goodness, Rabbie.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.200
So they are.

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:20.952
Can we eat them tonight?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.662
I don't see why not.

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.289
Come on, let's go ask Mrs. Crook.

00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.338
A grand potato, if ever I saw one.

00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:33.965
Ye've never seen one.

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:35.216
Not in Fraser land.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.384
Not till now.

00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:38.970
Ye were right tellin' us
to plant them, Claire.

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.430
'Tis a fine crop.

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:42.890
I dinna see how ye'd
ever grind them for parritch.

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:45.226
I dinna believe ye grind them, Mrs. Crook.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.352
Och, aye?

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:47.812
What do ye do with 'em, then?

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.439
You boil them.

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:51.274
- Eat them with salt.
- Aye.

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:53.526
- Butter is good, too.
- Or roast them.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.027
Or you can mash them with milk.

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.654
I dinna ken you could cook, Sassenach.

00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:00.575
I'm not sure I can cook,
but I can certainly boil a potato.

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.201
Then we shall have a feast.

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:05.288
- Ye did well.
- Wipe yer feet

00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:08.291
and take off yer filthy boots
before ye tramp all over this rug.

00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:09.500
Come along, lads.

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.461
You can help me scrub them clean.

00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:13.671
I ran into Hector on the way up.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:15.590
Got the post from him.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.344
Jamie, here's one for you.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:26.017
- Louise.
- It's the bill for the seed.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.687
And one from Aunt Jocasta.
Good, we haven't heard from her in months.

00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.189
Now, did ye get the plowshare fixed?

00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:33.316
Smitty says it's broken straight through.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.776
Canna be re-forged.

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:37.779
We'll have to hand-till
until we can get a new one.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:39.822
I canna believe I've become a farmer.

00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:45.787
Three French novels
and a book of poetry from Paris.

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.789
Which one shall we read tonight?

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.252
And what is it?

00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.385
"Dear cousin, so pleased.

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.972
Words cannot express my admiration
for your boldness and courage.

00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.682
My prayers are with you."

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.647
- Stuart Crest.
- Aye.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.942
It declares a Stuart's divine right
to the throne of Britain,

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:19.362
supported by the chieftains
of the Highland clans,

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:22.949
signed by those pledging loyalty
to Charles Stuart.

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:27.286
"MacKinnon, Oliphant,
MacDonald of Glencoe...

00:05:30.623 --> 00:05:33.042
James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser."

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.423
Jesus bloody Christ,
he's forged your signature.

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:42.343
Aye... he has.

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:46.222
Charles has landed in Scotland
and is gathering his army.

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:48.558
This was published, distributed.

00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.143
The names on this
are traitors to the crown.

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:53.896
Jamie.

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.882
It's all coming to pass, isn't it?

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:27.722
Jacobite rising, Culloden, the Clearances.

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.059
The destruction of all of this.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.061
So it would seem.

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:39.108
We could go to Ireland, or the colonies.

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.943
What of Ian and Jenny?

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:44.071
My nieces, nephews, our cousins?

00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.448
We can bring them with us.

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:46.782
All of them?

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:50.953
What of our tenants?

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:55.541
Leave them to the mercy
of the British butchers

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.001
if the Culloden is lost?

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:00.838
Your name on that document
brands you as a traitor to the British.

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.716
And you will be hung as one
if they catch you.

00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.218
We can't stay.

00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:17.146
We know what will happen
if the Jacobites lose the war. But...

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.108
But what if they win?

00:07:21.192 --> 00:07:22.526
They don't.

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.404
It's the verdict of history.

00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:28.616
Have you given up trying to change
the future, then, Sassenach?

00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:31.661
Well, after Paris, haven't you?

00:07:31.744 --> 00:07:34.872
Aye, Paris was bitter disappointment.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.086
But you can change the future.

00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:42.838
You've proven that.

00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:45.841
Thomas Baxter lives because of you.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.805
Paris was spared an outbreak
of smallpox because of you.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:57.728
And Louise de Rohan
will bear Charles Stuart's bairn...

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.690
because of you.

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:04.860
You want to fight for Prince Charles?

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:11.200
Fight... for our family.

00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:17.581
And for Scotland.

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.084
Canna see any other way.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.753
Can you?

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:25.381
Not one that we could live with.

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:31.220
They say the definition of insanity

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:35.016
is doing the same thing over and over
and expecting a different result.

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:38.394
Well, I do not ken
who "they" are, Sassenach...

00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:41.439
but I'll wager...

00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:46.152
"they" have never traveled through time.

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.795
So, with Daniel Wallace
and Duncan MacLennan,

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.964
ye should have 30 able-bodied men
from Lallybroch.

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:10.926
Good. Murtagh, I'll need ye
to bring the men to Kingussie.

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:15.639
Claire and I will meet you there
in two weeks,

00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:18.100
and we'll go together
to join the prince at Crieff.

00:09:18.184 --> 00:09:19.518
As ye say.

00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:22.396
And where will we be
during these two weeks?

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:28.944
Prince Charles has dispatched me to
enlist men and support from our kinsman,

00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:31.197
Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat.

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.575
Ye're going to see Lord Lovat?

00:09:35.076 --> 00:09:37.078
Ask him to do ye a favour?

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.123
Ask him to help preserve his country...

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.626
and restore the rightful king
to the throne.

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:46.420
He does have a history
of supporting the Jacobites, ye ken.

00:09:46.504 --> 00:09:50.466
Aye, and the British and anyone else
that will help him line his pockets

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:52.760
and claim the title
Chief of Clan Fraser of Lovat.

00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:56.055
A position he is entitled to
and has held for over 20 years.

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.058
You're defending the old buzzard, now?

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.019
Father must be birling in his grave.

00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:05.272
Who is Lord Lovat?

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:06.816
Our grandsire.

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.401
Who we've laid eyes on
but once in our lives,

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:11.862
when he came to visit
just after our mother died.

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:14.365
Father threw him out before
he could cross the threshold.

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:15.908
Why?

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:22.248
He tried to have our mother kidnapped
and taken to the Monach Isles

00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:24.792
in order to prevent our father
from marrying her.

00:10:26.085 --> 00:10:29.672
There was some bad blood
between Lovat and the MacKenzies.

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.674
A situation I assume
Prince Charles is unaware of?

00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:33.134
'Tis not only degrading

00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:35.094
for ye to crawl to that man
and ask him for help.

00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:36.887
'Tis a fool's errand.

00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:39.431
The old fox does nothing
that's not in his best interest

00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:41.892
- and never without a price.
- No.

00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:46.355
No, what would be foolish, Janet,
would to let pride stand in the way

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.191
of doing whatever I can
to save Lallybroch, Scotland,

00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:51.110
and everything that we hold dear.

00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:57.366
We'll leave for Beaufort Castle
first thing tomorrow.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:10.212
I havena been completely honest
with ye about my family, Sassenach.

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:13.549
- What do you mean?
- My father...

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.177
He was a bastard.

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:20.472
Acknowledged by his father,
Lord Lovat, but...

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.725
a bastard nonetheless.

00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:24.852
And your grandmother?

00:11:25.978 --> 00:11:27.521
Lord Lovat's kitchen maid.

00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:31.400
She raised my father at Beaufort Castle.

00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:36.655
I should've told ye before we wed.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:42.703
I'm sorry. It was cowardly of me.

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:47.708
Jamie... you must know
your father's parentage

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.335
makes no difference to me.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.504
Well...

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.424
it should.

00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:05.726
It doesn't.

00:12:20.658 --> 00:12:22.576
- Let's go to bed.
- Aye.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:00.674
The bairn couldna sleep...

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.427
and neither could Jamie.

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.138
He thought they could keep
each other company for a bit

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:07.931
while Ian and I slept.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.144
And he's trying to get back
on my good side.

00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.272
Did it work?

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:16.857
It's a start.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.199
Ye can talk to a wee one in a way
you canna talk to anyone else.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:30.537
Ye can pour out yer heart to them
without choosing your words or...

00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:33.374
holding anything back at all.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.507
And that's a comfort to the soul.

00:14:47.763 --> 00:14:50.432
It's the way we talk to them
before they're born.

00:14:51.517 --> 00:14:52.810
Ye know.

00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:57.481
Yes.

00:14:58.649 --> 00:14:59.858
I know.

00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:07.032
The man has to wait
until the child's born...

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.744
and then they hold their bairn and...

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.874
feel all the things that might be
and all the things that might never be...

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.004
and weep, not knowing
which ones will come to pass.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.478
- Take care of your Fraser.
- Aye.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.565
And you yours.

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:42.901
Take this.

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:45.654
It brought Ian back to me from France.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.995
Ye gave Ian a token when
we went to France, and no' me?

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.290
And him not even your betrothed
at the time.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.208
Don't make me regret giving it to ye now.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.843
If ye don't come back, brother,
I'll never forgive ye.

00:16:09.428 --> 00:16:12.139
Never... is a very long time.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.099
I know.

00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:16.643
Just where do ye think ye're going?

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.396
Well, with Milord.

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.816
Ye're too young to fight, laddie.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.443
Ye'll bide here wi' us.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:26.945
You can help Rabbie in the stables
till Milord returns.

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:29.698
But... I belong with you.

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:32.910
Is that not what you told me, Milady,

00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:34.786
that I will always have a home with you?

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.748
Yes, of course.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.791
- But sometimes, it's...
- He's right.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.378
His place is no' here without us...

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.841
nor in France on his own.

00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:52.262
Bring him with ye, Murtagh,
when ye come with the men.

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.680
Aye.

00:16:53.764 --> 00:16:55.807
If I havena killed him first.

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:59.937
Dinna fash, Claire.
We'll keep him well away from the battle.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.981
The outcome is in yer hands, laddie.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.778
A good soldier must learn
to obey his commanding officer...

00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:12.324
as well as his general.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.419
Take care of each other.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.381
And watch out for my grandsire.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.174
I will.

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.134
Bye, Jenny.

00:18:04.293 --> 00:18:06.545
During our ride to Beaufort Castle,

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:10.048
Jamie filled me in
on what he knew of his grandfather.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.426
Over the last 50 years,

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:15.887
Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat
had been alternately loyal

00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:18.098
to both the exiled King James

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.934
and the monarchs sitting
on the British throne.

00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:23.729
His personal life was equally infamous.

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.024
Aside from numerous
extramarital dalliances,

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:29.818
Lord Lovat had had three wives,

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.446
two of them acquired by nefarious means.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:42.247
Lord Lovat will be with you shortly.

00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:52.633
I do wish we'd had a chance
to freshen up a bit

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.301
before meeting your grandfather.

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.136
Dinna fash, Sassenach.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:57.846
You look bonny...

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.435
though ye do have a few
teasel heads in your hair.

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.271
Leave 'em. They suit her.

00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:14.696
Colum.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.074
I arrived this morning, myself.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.160
I saw ye enter the courtyard
from the window.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.536
What are ye doing here?

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:26.166
Well, I'm here to discuss a response
to the rebellion with Lord Lovat...

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:28.919
as I assume you are.

00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:30.754
War.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.674
It makes for strange bedfellows.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:37.552
I'm pleased to see that ye're well.

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:41.390
You'll have to excuse me
if I find that hard to believe.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.142
The witch trial, Colum.

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:45.727
Ye seem to be implying that I...

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.438
I had something to do
with your involvement in that.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.732
It is my impression that ye were

00:19:50.816 --> 00:19:52.317
simply in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.527
Yes, I was.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.488
Thanks to a message from
your kitchen maid, Laoghaire,

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.574
who just happened to know the exact
time and place of the arrest.

00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:04.371
A gross overstepping of her place,
for which I had her beaten.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:08.125
I would've thrown her out of Leoch,
but her grandmother, Mrs. Fitz,

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.627
persuaded me she could
keep the girl in check.

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.379
Is Dougal with ye?

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.672
No.

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:19.428
It became clear that
it was best for the clan

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:22.180
that my brother remain at his own estate.

00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:24.975
But surely Dougal would be
the one leading clan MacKenzie

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.852
in fighting for King James?

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:30.689
I'd forgotten what
a curious mind you have, lass.

00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:34.776
So the rumor is true.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:40.115
The grandson of Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.701
has bound himself to a Sassenach.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:46.371
But I suppose ye are
yer father's son, after all.

00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:50.041
Who's to expect the boy
to have more sense choosing a wife

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.461
than did the bastard who made him?

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:57.466
At least I had no need to take a wife
by means of rape or trickery.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.347
No' as serious as yer father.

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:05.640
Good.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.226
Enough breath wasted on a woman.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.352
Leave us.

00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:14.983
It's time to talk politics
with my grandson and my rival.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.798
While Jamie's meeting dragged on,

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:42.219
I took the opportunity to look over
the place Lord Lovat called home.

00:21:43.929 --> 00:21:45.180
Mistress Fraser?

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.724
I've been looking for ye
since I heard you were here.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.395
Laoghaire.

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.397
Did the laird not tell ye I was with him?

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.358
- No.
- My grandmother sent me along

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:59.486
to wash his laundry
and help wherever I'm needed.

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.571
I wanted to find ye, though, because...

00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:08.328
I need to tell you.

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.288
I am changed.

00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:14.918
And I am sorry beyond measure
for the horrible wrong I did to ye.

00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:16.795
My grandmother has made me see

00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:20.090
I canna be right with God
until I make amends

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.801
for the pain my evil actions have caused.

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:27.931
I believe it is God brought us
together here so I could do so.

00:22:29.975 --> 00:22:31.017
God?

00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:33.937
You speak of God?

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:40.068
How often have I thought about what
I would do whenever I saw you again?

00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:44.573
I have fantasized
all manner of violent acts

00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:46.116
that I would subject you to.

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:48.326
To all of them.

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.955
Ending with lighting the pyre
beneath your feet...

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:56.626
and dancing on your ashes
as you promised to dance on mine.

00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:05.468
I don't hate you, Laoghaire.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.640
I pity you.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.853
The dark places you must've inhabited...

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:20.066
in the hopes of getting something
that you'll never have.

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:26.031
As for getting right with God...

00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:30.035
you'll just have to find another way.

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:33.204
'Cause I can't help you.

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.547
Maybe God did bring us together.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.593
Somehow, I... I feel lighter.

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:49.262
Ye're more forgiving than I am, Sassenach.

00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:52.766
I wouldna give that brazen besom
the time of day.

00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:54.100
Perhaps.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:57.979
So, will I be allowed
to join you at dinner tonight?

00:23:58.855 --> 00:23:59.981
Aye.

00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:03.860
Aye, my grandsire's no' opposed to
a bit of decoration at the dinner table.

00:24:04.903 --> 00:24:07.155
As long as that decoration doesna speak.

00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:11.493
Aye.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.453
Just like that.

00:24:16.373 --> 00:24:17.540
Now, come along.

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.801
Every man here knows
that to most British...

00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:31.721
all Highlanders,
no matter their allegiance...

00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:34.557
we're all the same.

00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:39.312
Savage dogs better put down than let live.

00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:41.856
And after three uprisings,

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.402
the British Army will be motivated
to put us down for good.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.783
To save our clans, our country,
our very way of life...

00:24:52.409 --> 00:24:57.539
we must band together under
the true king, King James. Fight.

00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:01.167
And we must win.

00:25:05.213 --> 00:25:08.800
We're very fortunate to have among us

00:25:08.883 --> 00:25:12.429
such a close confidant of the prince.

00:25:14.472 --> 00:25:15.849
Isn't that so, Lovat?

00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:20.395
We're lucky to have somebody
to give us an inside view

00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:22.313
of this holy rebellion.

00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:26.025
Aye, but I dinna know how holy it is.

00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:31.531
So can you tell us, then, nephew,

00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:35.410
how much support have the French
agreed to give?

00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:42.834
The French have already
supported us, Colum...

00:25:43.334 --> 00:25:46.254
by engaging the British Army in Flanders,

00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.465
reducing the troops
remaining here at home.

00:25:56.639 --> 00:26:00.852
The prince is certain the French
will want to press the advantage,

00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:03.855
send men and artillery
to support the Jacobites.

00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:09.110
So the French have not yet
committed to Prince Charles?

00:26:09.194 --> 00:26:13.573
Always an unreliable ally, the French.

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:19.537
We will welcome the French support
when it comes, but we dinna need it.

00:26:27.504 --> 00:26:31.424
The Jacobite army is already
1,000 men strong in Crieff.

00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:38.348
MacDonalds, Camerons, Stuarts, and Grants.

00:26:40.308 --> 00:26:41.851
And more joining every day...

00:26:43.853 --> 00:26:46.231
while the majority of the British Army

00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:48.858
remains on the continent
licking their wounds.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.488
I have heard the British
have offered £30,000

00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:55.240
for the capture of Prince Charles.

00:26:56.866 --> 00:26:59.118
Meaning what?

00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:04.082
Meaning the British
see Prince Charles as a real threat.

00:27:04.749 --> 00:27:06.626
Ye'll join us then, cousin?

00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:09.838
Perhaps the British know,
as the rest of us do,

00:27:09.921 --> 00:27:13.258
how many cullions there are amongst
the Campbells and the Camerons,

00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:16.761
men who would sell their own
grandmothers for half that amount.

00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:17.887
Aye.

00:27:21.224 --> 00:27:24.102
- Well, I...
- For £30,000,

00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:27.772
the British could end this
rebellion before it even starts.

00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:31.526
A fair sight less than it would
cost them to wage a war.

00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:41.536
I hadn't considered that.

00:27:42.412 --> 00:27:46.624
Then sit down,
ye mealy-mouthed wee smout,

00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:49.210
and dinna speak again
until ye have considered

00:27:49.294 --> 00:27:50.670
what ye're about to say.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.507
Bring us more wine...

00:27:56.384 --> 00:27:57.594
my lovely.

00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.556
And a glass of milk for my boy.

00:28:06.352 --> 00:28:08.605
Enough war talk tonight.

00:28:23.995 --> 00:28:26.664
You know, I got the impression
that Colum was trying to use you

00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:29.042
to convince Lord Lovat
not to join the rebellion.

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.251
Aye.

00:28:32.462 --> 00:28:36.507
The first Jacobite rebellions failed,
and Colum will never support another.

00:28:36.591 --> 00:28:39.385
He wants Lovat's clan to stay
neutral with the MacKenzies,

00:28:39.469 --> 00:28:41.971
knowing that the smaller clans
will follow...

00:28:43.431 --> 00:28:47.018
and the rebellion will collapse
before it ever gets started.

00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:50.063
Well, why doesn't Colum
just speak to him directly?

00:28:50.146 --> 00:28:52.732
Because my grandsire
doesna trust my uncle.

00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:58.321
Using me is
a much more effective strategy.

00:28:59.155 --> 00:29:01.908
I need to speak to Lovat on my own,

00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:05.119
without Colum leading me
to make his arguments for him.

00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:11.292
It's a pity young Simon
is such a spineless creature.

00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:14.170
I believe he could influence
his father's decision

00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:16.506
if he took a strong stance for our side.

00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:18.800
The man has nothing but contempt
for the poor boy.

00:29:20.218 --> 00:29:22.720
He's just trying to toughen him up,

00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:26.557
make him a viable successor
to lead Clan Fraser of Lovat.

00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:34.399
My grandsire had the perfect opportunity

00:29:34.482 --> 00:29:37.527
to say no to us tonight, but he didn't.

00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:39.570
Perhaps Jenny was right.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.242
He wants something in exchange.

00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:53.501
Do ye think ye can toy with me?

00:29:54.627 --> 00:29:57.046
Ye're keeping something
from me, ye old hag,

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.173
and I'm no' havin' it.

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.977
Are you all right?

00:30:12.353 --> 00:30:14.397
Here, let me help you.

00:30:16.858 --> 00:30:19.068
Thank you, Mistress.

00:30:21.154 --> 00:30:22.280
I'm Claire.

00:30:22.363 --> 00:30:23.823
Maisri.

00:30:23.906 --> 00:30:25.158
Lord Lovat's seer.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.202
Wait.

00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:42.925
I'll wager yer father painted
a black portrait of my character.

00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:45.928
He said very little about ye.

00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:48.306
He chose that MacKenzie whore...

00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:51.726
And I'll ask ye to keep a civil tongue
when you speak of my mother!

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.228
Over me, his father, twice.

00:30:54.312 --> 00:30:56.105
First when I told him not to marry her.

00:30:56.189 --> 00:30:57.523
And yer kidnapping attempt failed.

00:30:57.607 --> 00:30:59.817
Second time, she was dead and buried.

00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:02.445
I was willing to forgive him,
make him my successor,

00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:04.113
despite the fact he was a bastard.

00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:10.495
And he chose her memory and that place...

00:31:10.578 --> 00:31:11.746
Lallybroch.

00:31:11.829 --> 00:31:13.164
...over me.

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.463
- Is it true?
- What?

00:31:22.048 --> 00:31:25.343
That you've no' pledged yer fealty
to Colum MacKenzie?

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.138
That's what ye're after, is it?

00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:37.146
My fealty to you, in exchange
for sending aid to Prince Charles?

00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:41.859
To be honest, I'm more interested
in what goes with it.

00:31:44.237 --> 00:31:46.114
What need have ye of Lallybroch?

00:31:46.572 --> 00:31:50.785
The tenants' rents would probably
make no difference to a place like this.

00:31:50.868 --> 00:31:54.997
What I do with that damnable place
would be no concern of yers.

00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:59.210
I'm yer grandsire
and head of your clan, after all.

00:31:59.335 --> 00:32:01.462
I demand my due.

00:32:02.046 --> 00:32:05.508
If I wouldna give my pledge to Colum,
who I know to be kin,

00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.845
then what sort of fool would I be
to give it to an old twister

00:32:08.928 --> 00:32:11.514
that may or may not share my blood?

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.642
You made free with yer housemaids.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.353
Perhaps others did, too.

00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:23.734
Christ, laddie!

00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:38.916
Implying yer grandmother's a whore
to keep what you want?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.210
Ye're my kin, all right.

00:32:41.752 --> 00:32:44.297
Would that my son had half yer mettle...

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.341
I'll give ye the same pledge I gave Colum.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:49.510
My help and goodwill.

00:32:50.219 --> 00:32:53.431
And my obedience to yer word,
so long as my feet rest on Lovat soil.

00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:54.849
Did ye no' hear me?

00:32:56.893 --> 00:32:59.312
It's yer father's precious estate
I'm after.

00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:06.319
If ye'll no' give me Lallybroch in
exchange for men for Prince Charles...

00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:09.447
how about this?

00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:14.368
Lallybroch for yer wife's honor.

00:33:23.044 --> 00:33:24.170
Go ahead.

00:33:25.171 --> 00:33:27.465
Try to ravish my wife.

00:33:28.007 --> 00:33:29.759
And after she's done with ye...

00:33:30.718 --> 00:33:33.179
I'll send in the maid
to sweep up yer remains.

00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:37.266
Not I, lad, though I've taken
my pleasure with worse.

00:33:37.725 --> 00:33:40.228
Your grandmother comes to mind.

00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:43.356
But there are many men in Beaufort Castle

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:45.358
who'd be of a mind to put your...

00:33:46.442 --> 00:33:51.197
Sassenach wench
to the only use she's good for.

00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:55.076
Ye canna guard her night and day.

00:33:55.493 --> 00:33:56.661
No.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.082
I needn't worry, Grandsire.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.295
My wife's a rare woman.

00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:08.673
Ye ken.

00:34:08.798 --> 00:34:10.049
A wise woman.

00:34:13.177 --> 00:34:14.845
La Dame Blanche.

00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.431
"The White Lady."

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.433
The Sassenach?

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:21.352
A witch?

00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:24.814
Aye, it's true.

00:34:27.275 --> 00:34:32.154
The man that takes her in unholy embrace
will have his privates blasted...

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.324
like a frostbitten apple.

00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:38.369
And his soul...

00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:41.414
will...

00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:43.708
burn...

00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:47.837
forever in hell.

00:35:02.018 --> 00:35:03.352
Like that.

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:12.194
My grandsire has a great respect
for the supernatural.

00:35:12.778 --> 00:35:14.363
No' for anything else,

00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:16.866
but ye should take care
the next few days if I'm no' here.

00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:19.118
Well, he didn't seem that frightened
of that poor woman

00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:21.078
when he tossed her out into the corridor.

00:35:21.162 --> 00:35:22.330
Maisri's but a seer.

00:35:22.413 --> 00:35:24.790
She's not a white lady, like my wife.

00:35:24.874 --> 00:35:26.626
But she did know something
she wasna telling him.

00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:29.420
Your grandfather really is a brute,
isn't he?

00:35:29.503 --> 00:35:32.923
Aye. A brute that may soon
own my ancestral home.

00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:37.470
You can't be seriously thinking
about giving him what he wants?

00:35:37.553 --> 00:35:39.347
Well, the prince will hardly
put much stock

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.432
in my abilities to lead men or wage war

00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:44.977
if I'm not even able to persuade
my own grandsire to support our cause.

00:35:47.021 --> 00:35:48.522
Well, what about young Simon?

00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:52.735
What if we persuade him
to stand up to his father...

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:56.238
- declare his support for the rebellion?
- Aye.

00:35:56.322 --> 00:36:00.493
Aye, then Lovat may send his men
if only to protect his heir, but...

00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:05.456
after that scene last night,
it'll take more time than we have

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:09.335
to give the boy the confidence
he needs to truly defy his father.

00:36:11.629 --> 00:36:15.174
Perhaps it depends on what we use
to boost his confidence.

00:36:36.487 --> 00:36:38.572
Is that Jamie's shirt?

00:36:38.656 --> 00:36:40.116
I've done nothing to it.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.203
Didn't mean to imply that you had.

00:36:44.787 --> 00:36:46.622
I have changed, ye ken.

00:36:47.081 --> 00:36:49.667
I have repented and asked
God's forgiveness,

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.252
and it was working.

00:36:51.836 --> 00:36:56.674
I thought he brought you both here
to help me, but it was to test me.

00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:00.845
In the great hall,
Jamie didn't even see me.

00:37:00.928 --> 00:37:02.513
'Twas like I didna exist.

00:37:03.973 --> 00:37:06.434
If ye willna avenge yerself,
ye must leave me be.

00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:10.771
Perhaps I could find my way
to forgive you.

00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:13.607
- But Jamie...
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

00:37:13.691 --> 00:37:16.402
Jamie will never love you, Laoghaire.

00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:21.907
But there might be a way
to earn his forgiveness.

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:25.703
For him to think of you without rancor.

00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:28.831
And why would you want him to do that?

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:33.085
Because we need Lord Lovat

00:37:33.169 --> 00:37:36.130
to send his men and weapons
to fight for Prince Charles,

00:37:36.213 --> 00:37:39.258
and we believe he might do this
if young Simon stood up to him

00:37:39.341 --> 00:37:40.968
and took Jamie's side.

00:37:41.051 --> 00:37:43.012
And what is that to do with me?

00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.930
Young Simon is infatuated with you.

00:37:45.014 --> 00:37:47.600
You could use that to help persuade him.

00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:50.227
No.

00:37:50.603 --> 00:37:52.605
I'll not sink further
into the pit of depravity.

00:37:52.688 --> 00:37:54.356
I'll not give up my maidenhead for you!

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.942
No one is asking you to give up anything.

00:37:57.818 --> 00:37:59.862
Besides, it's not for me.

00:37:59.945 --> 00:38:01.238
It's for Jamie.

00:38:03.908 --> 00:38:07.328
A woman has more to offer a man
than her body.

00:38:08.204 --> 00:38:12.166
When a man is in love,
he craves his beloved's approval.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:16.670
He wishes to please her,
and to look heroic in her eyes.

00:38:18.047 --> 00:38:20.925
And if I do whatever it is
ye have in mind...

00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:23.719
ye'll speak to Jamie on my behalf?

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.096
Yes.

00:38:29.475 --> 00:38:31.435
I canna tell you how I know,
but I do.

00:38:32.436 --> 00:38:33.604
You must believe me.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.190
The only way to survive...

00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:40.361
is to fight and win.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.822
And we need the weapons and men to do so.

00:38:42.905 --> 00:38:45.616
Remaining neutral will be seen
as treason by whatever side wins.

00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:48.452
Ye know? Ye just know?

00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:50.079
Ye sound like a madman!

00:38:50.955 --> 00:38:53.457
History guides my course in this matter.

00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:54.583
History!

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:57.086
Not wild beliefs and wishful thinking.

00:38:58.087 --> 00:38:59.338
The other risings,

00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:02.341
they failed because
there was no outside support,

00:39:02.424 --> 00:39:05.094
and that support does not exist now.

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:10.641
If we do not send men to fight,
this rebellion will melt away.

00:39:11.392 --> 00:39:16.689
And when that happens, we will be
left alone, as we were in the past.

00:39:19.525 --> 00:39:21.026
Lord Lovat.

00:39:22.027 --> 00:39:23.696
He would see that, too,

00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:26.407
if only the vengeful prize of Lallybroch

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.492
was not dangling in front of his eyes.

00:39:28.576 --> 00:39:30.661
And he would agree to neutrality.

00:39:35.457 --> 00:39:38.752
Jamie, ye were always headstrong,

00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:41.589
but ye were never reckless
with the lives of others.

00:39:42.756 --> 00:39:46.719
For yer sake, and for the sake
of all you hold dear...

00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:50.222
do not make this bargain with that man.

00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:54.059
Do not trade your home
for a war ye canna win.

00:39:54.685 --> 00:39:56.228
Will ye promise me that?

00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:00.482
I promise you, uncle.

00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:09.408
I promise you,

00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:15.247
I will do what I must to save those
things you and I hold most dear.

00:40:38.312 --> 00:40:42.149
So nice of you to volunteer
to show me the chapel, Master Lovat.

00:40:42.232 --> 00:40:44.401
I believe it was yer idea.

00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:46.862
It's so peaceful here.

00:40:46.946 --> 00:40:48.822
Do you plan to do much
when you become laird?

00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:51.075
I've no' given it much thought.

00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:54.662
My father's still a vigorous man.

00:40:55.454 --> 00:40:57.623
Some have speculated he's immortal.

00:40:58.749 --> 00:41:03.170
And as ye may have noticed,
he doesn't have much respect for me.

00:41:04.755 --> 00:41:06.340
My husband confided in me

00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:09.510
that his father sometimes
exposed him to public scorn,

00:41:09.593 --> 00:41:11.553
to make him a better leader of men.

00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:13.681
Laoghaire.

00:41:17.226 --> 00:41:18.852
I hope we're not disturbing you.

00:41:18.936 --> 00:41:20.062
No, Milady.

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:22.147
Just collecting some mushrooms
for the cook.

00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:27.611
I'd like a few private moments
in the chapel.

00:41:27.695 --> 00:41:29.822
Do you mind waiting here for me?

00:41:32.074 --> 00:41:33.325
Well...

00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:37.204
if Mistress Laoghaire wouldn't
prefer her solitude...

00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:39.707
No, I'd welcome the company.

00:41:45.587 --> 00:41:46.964
It's a dreich day.

00:41:47.798 --> 00:41:48.966
Aye.

00:41:53.178 --> 00:41:54.722
Do you like mushrooms?

00:41:54.805 --> 00:41:56.306
Not much, no.

00:41:59.226 --> 00:42:00.477
I like poetry.

00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:01.895
So do I.

00:42:05.858 --> 00:42:10.320
"Though hurricanes rise
and rise every wind,

00:42:10.404 --> 00:42:13.198
they'll ne'er make a tempest
like that in my mind.

00:42:13.282 --> 00:42:17.161
Though loudest of thunder
on louder waves roar...

00:42:17.911 --> 00:42:20.748
that's naething like leaving
my love on the shore.

00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:22.499
- To leave thee..."
- Perhaps you'd like to

00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:24.376
sit down on the tree.

00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.118
Maisri.

00:42:59.328 --> 00:43:00.913
It's Claire Fraser.

00:43:01.663 --> 00:43:03.499
We met in the corridor.

00:43:04.124 --> 00:43:06.335
Lord Lovat's tenants
do not like someone like me

00:43:06.418 --> 00:43:08.045
in the house of God.

00:43:09.046 --> 00:43:11.882
This is the only place
where my mind goes quiet.

00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:13.300
I don't know why.

00:43:16.345 --> 00:43:18.931
They say you are a "White Lady."

00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:22.059
Yes, they do say that.

00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:25.229
What brings you into a church, then?

00:43:26.897 --> 00:43:28.816
It was cold outside.

00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:34.113
I'm glad to see that
you're doing all right.

00:43:34.196 --> 00:43:36.615
Lord Lovat was so rough with you
the other day.

00:43:36.698 --> 00:43:38.992
His Lordship is not an easy master.

00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:41.161
He asks what I see

00:43:41.245 --> 00:43:43.956
and beats me when I tell him
things that displease him.

00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:48.460
Does it always come to pass,
the things that you see?

00:43:48.544 --> 00:43:50.087
Mostly, aye.

00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:54.716
Although, sometimes an action
can change things.

00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:56.927
When I still lived in the village,

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.681
I saw Lachlan Gibbons' daughter's
man wrapped in seaweed,

00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:03.433
and the eels stirring beneath his shirt.

00:44:03.851 --> 00:44:05.644
I told Lachlan what I'd seen,

00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:09.690
and he went straight away
and stove a hole in the boy's boat.

00:44:09.773 --> 00:44:13.861
Lord, there was a stramash,
a right to-do.

00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:16.864
But when the great storm came
the next week...

00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:19.908
three men were drowned,

00:44:19.992 --> 00:44:24.037
and that boy was safe at home,
still mending his boat.

00:44:26.123 --> 00:44:27.291
What did you see...

00:44:28.417 --> 00:44:30.836
right before Lord Lovat threw you out?

00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:34.756
I promise, I won't tell him
that you told me.

00:44:38.302 --> 00:44:41.722
He was standing there before
the fire in his study,

00:44:41.805 --> 00:44:43.557
but it was daylight.

00:44:45.017 --> 00:44:50.981
A man stood behind him, still as
a tree, his face covered in black.

00:44:51.857 --> 00:44:57.070
And across His Lordship's face,
there fell the shadow of an axe.

00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:03.994
But if you told him,
he could change his behavior,

00:45:04.077 --> 00:45:05.621
perhaps change the outcome.

00:45:05.704 --> 00:45:06.830
Aye.

00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:09.833
Or he might just kill the messenger.

00:45:11.627 --> 00:45:14.838
Mistress Claire, where are ye?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.925
Mistress Claire?

00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:19.718
I'll be right there!

00:45:24.723 --> 00:45:26.099
Where is young Simon?

00:45:26.183 --> 00:45:28.310
He ran off like a feart wee mouse.

00:45:28.393 --> 00:45:30.854
- What did you do?
- Everything ye said.

00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:32.022
I flattered him.

00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:34.232
I told him how much I admired
a man who made decisions,

00:45:34.316 --> 00:45:35.359
who thought for himself.

00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:37.819
I gave him a keek down
the front of my dress, I...

00:45:37.903 --> 00:45:39.696
I told you it wasn't about sex.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.239
No wonder he ran off.

00:45:41.615 --> 00:45:43.200
Well, other than reciting verse,

00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:46.286
he wasna doing much to hold up
his end of the conversation.

00:45:46.828 --> 00:45:48.163
I tried!

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:01.843
Jamie?

00:46:02.844 --> 00:46:03.971
Aye.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.224
I thought I'd find you in here.

00:46:07.975 --> 00:46:12.270
More and more these days,
I think I'd prefer to be a beast.

00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:17.025
No luck with Colum, then?

00:46:18.402 --> 00:46:19.528
No.

00:46:20.195 --> 00:46:22.155
And you, with young Simon?

00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:23.323
No.

00:46:23.407 --> 00:46:25.993
I did find out what Maisri
wouldn't tell Lord Lovat, though.

00:46:27.452 --> 00:46:28.537
Aye?

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.039
She saw his death
at the hands of an executioner.

00:46:31.123 --> 00:46:32.791
A traitor's death.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.710
I dinna suppose she mentioned

00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:38.463
if the executioner was in the employ
of King George or King James?

00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:40.298
No, I'm afraid not.

00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:43.677
I promised Colum...

00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:48.348
I'd do what I had to,
to save the Highlanders.

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.018
So I must.

00:46:51.101 --> 00:46:52.477
Jamie, it's too much.

00:46:53.145 --> 00:46:55.397
Let's just go to Prince Charles
with the men from Lallybroch.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.524
I canna go to the prince a failure.

00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:01.236
It seems I canna get the men from
Lovat without giving him my land.

00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:05.490
So, unless yer planning on declaring
yerself a visitor from the future

00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:08.785
and describing what will happen
if we dinna fight and win,

00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:10.912
then I dinna see I have much choice.

00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:36.104
I have had my secretary
prepare a neutrality pact

00:47:36.229 --> 00:47:40.525
between the Frasers of Lovat
and the MacKenzies of Leoch.

00:47:45.322 --> 00:47:51.495
I have also had him prepare a deed
of sasine for Lallybroch estate.

00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.540
Assigning the property to me.

00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:01.755
Sign it, and ye'll have yer men
for King James.

00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:04.633
Don't sign it,

00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:07.385
and I'll agree to neutrality
with MacKenzie here.

00:48:11.223 --> 00:48:12.933
Which will it be?

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.854
Ye'll let this boy
decide the fate of Clan Lovat?

00:48:17.938 --> 00:48:20.065
He's not even yer recognized heir.

00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:22.275
I have made this decision.

00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:25.153
The boy is but an obstacle in my way.

00:48:26.863 --> 00:48:30.158
What will it be, obstacle?

00:48:30.534 --> 00:48:31.785
Dinna be a fool, Jamie.

00:48:43.839 --> 00:48:49.261
I do this to ensure the future
of my family and people.

00:49:05.152 --> 00:49:06.945
What are ye staring at?

00:49:07.028 --> 00:49:08.071
Claire?

00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:13.577
No!

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.246
It's another vision.

00:49:17.747 --> 00:49:19.332
- Claire.
- Leave her be!

00:49:19.416 --> 00:49:21.418
Do no' give me orders about my own wife!

00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:23.128
Claire! Claire, Claire.

00:49:24.129 --> 00:49:25.589
What did she see?

00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:27.924
- Jamie!
- What did ye see, witch?

00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:30.218
- Stay back!
- Lovat.

00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:32.846
Can you not see this
for the pretense that it is?

00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:34.014
Pretense?

00:49:34.431 --> 00:49:37.100
You know that she was tried as a witch

00:49:37.184 --> 00:49:39.895
by those that dinna understand
the difference between black magic...

00:49:41.271 --> 00:49:42.856
and the power of the old ones.

00:49:45.192 --> 00:49:47.611
What did she see?

00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:50.071
You don't need to answer him, Claire.

00:49:50.155 --> 00:49:52.782
She will if she wants
to walk out of this room.

00:49:56.077 --> 00:49:59.206
No, it's all right, Jamie.

00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:11.009
I saw you...

00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:16.097
standing in bright sunlight.

00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:20.435
There was a man behind you.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.648
He was wearing a black hood...

00:50:25.899 --> 00:50:28.944
shadow of an axe across your face!

00:50:31.029 --> 00:50:32.405
Whose man?

00:50:33.156 --> 00:50:34.407
Whose executioner?

00:50:35.867 --> 00:50:39.246
King James or King George?

00:50:41.539 --> 00:50:43.166
I... I don't remember.

00:50:48.088 --> 00:50:49.547
The ground...

00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.551
was covered in white roses.

00:50:53.927 --> 00:50:56.137
The symbol of the Jacobites!

00:50:56.221 --> 00:50:57.264
No...

00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:01.518
Witch! I'll cut out yer tongue!

00:51:10.402 --> 00:51:13.446
How dare you thwart me, boy.

00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:22.080
You and MacKenzie are fearful old men.

00:51:23.832 --> 00:51:25.542
And you're wrong.

00:51:26.376 --> 00:51:28.169
My cousin is right.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.799
It's our duty to stand up
for our country and our kinsmen.

00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:36.511
I will fight for King James.

00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:40.682
I will fight to change
the White Lady's vision.

00:51:42.976 --> 00:51:44.644
Even if ye will not.

00:52:11.838 --> 00:52:13.340
The Frasers of Lovat...

00:52:17.761 --> 00:52:20.263
will stand with the MacKenzies of Leoch.

00:52:21.139 --> 00:52:24.225
We will remain neutral in the war.

00:52:36.488 --> 00:52:38.448
I wish ye luck, my boy.

00:52:39.366 --> 00:52:43.745
Come, MacKenzie, let's drink
to our newly formed alliance.

00:53:06.768 --> 00:53:07.936
I'm ready.

00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:11.022
Ye did well, young Simon.

00:53:11.106 --> 00:53:13.024
I'm proud to be yer kinsman.

00:53:13.108 --> 00:53:15.026
And I'll be proud to fight by yer side.

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:17.487
I'll wait for ye outside the gate.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.738
Aye.

00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:20.782
So we go to the prince empty-handed.

00:53:20.865 --> 00:53:22.826
Well, at least we were able
to save Lallybroch.

00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:24.702
Aye.

00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:43.471
Go back to yer home and yer family.

00:53:43.555 --> 00:53:46.099
I told you, uncle, I canna do that.

00:53:48.685 --> 00:53:52.647
Can you not convince him
to listen to reason and go home?

00:53:53.565 --> 00:53:55.692
You've known him longer than I have.

00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:57.110
What do you think?

00:53:57.193 --> 00:54:00.029
I think it's a blessing
that his mother didn't live

00:54:00.113 --> 00:54:02.574
to see what a reckless fool she spawned.

00:54:07.745 --> 00:54:09.330
Give me your hand.

00:54:44.407 --> 00:54:45.867
We must away as well, Claire.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:48.369
I need to be in Kingussie
by the end of the week.

00:54:49.037 --> 00:54:50.205
Wait.

00:54:50.872 --> 00:54:53.958
Before we go, there's something
that I need you to do for me.

00:54:54.042 --> 00:54:55.084
Aye.

00:54:55.585 --> 00:54:57.712
Say thank you to Laoghaire.

00:54:58.379 --> 00:54:59.547
"Thank you"?

00:55:01.674 --> 00:55:05.261
For what? Not trying to have you
arrested in the last few days?

00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:10.141
Please. Do it for me?
I'll explain it all later.

00:55:11.726 --> 00:55:12.852
Aye.

00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:25.865
I...

00:55:30.203 --> 00:55:32.247
I'm told to thank ye.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.585
For what, I dinna ken, but...

00:55:39.295 --> 00:55:40.880
Thank you, Laoghaire.

00:55:42.423 --> 00:55:45.593
I hope one day I can also
earn yer forgiveness, Jamie.

00:55:49.639 --> 00:55:51.140
And yer love.

00:55:54.936 --> 00:55:56.104
Let's go.

00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:39.981
Who are they?

00:56:44.986 --> 00:56:46.654
My father's men.

00:56:48.072 --> 00:56:50.325
Come on.

00:56:50.408 --> 00:56:52.702
Go. Go on. Come on.

00:56:58.458 --> 00:57:01.419
Don't sit there gaping at me,
ye glaiket sumph!

00:57:01.628 --> 00:57:02.545
Go see to yer men!

00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:11.429
Turning that one into a soldier

00:57:11.512 --> 00:57:14.098
will be a greater feat
than beating the British.

00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:18.728
What vision do ye have
for me now, White Lady?

00:57:19.604 --> 00:57:21.230
I don't understand.

00:57:21.314 --> 00:57:24.901
Now it will seem my grandsire
has sent his heir to fight.

00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:29.822
The Stuarts will credit Lovat with
supporting King James, should they win.

00:57:29.906 --> 00:57:32.283
They canna execute me for treason.

00:57:33.368 --> 00:57:35.370
But what about the neutrality agreement?

00:57:35.453 --> 00:57:37.789
I trust old Colum MacKenzie is right.

00:57:38.164 --> 00:57:41.084
And that will protect me
if the British should win.

00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:43.753
What will you say about your son
fighting for the Jacobites?

00:57:43.836 --> 00:57:46.798
He's his own man, that one.
Ye saw it yourself last night.

00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:48.883
Persuaded others to follow.

00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:53.096
I thank ye, White Lady.

00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:55.556
I couldna have got it all without ye.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.933
Ye didna get Lallybroch.

00:57:58.017 --> 00:58:00.395
Not yet. Aye. Come on!

00:58:02.146 --> 00:58:06.484
Please... tell me
I'm nothing like him, Sassenach.

00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:10.446
I'm afraid I have seen
a similarly devious turn of mind.

00:58:11.364 --> 00:58:14.367
I might have to rethink our agreement
not to lie to one another.

00:58:20.957 --> 00:58:25.336
As we put distance between ourselves
and Jamie's loathsome grandfather,

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.838
my heart lightened.

00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:30.425
We had Lovat's men now.

00:58:30.508 --> 00:58:32.927
Jamie would have the prince's favour

00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:37.181
and at least the opportunity
to steer the rebellion to victory.

00:58:37.265 --> 00:58:40.309
Maisri had said
we could change the future.

00:58:40.643 --> 00:58:42.645
Perhaps we already had.
