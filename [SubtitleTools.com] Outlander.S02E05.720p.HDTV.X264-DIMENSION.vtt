Annalise... _

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:10.815
I can guarantee the
amount of 40,000 pounds

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:12.316
to be made available to you.

00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.401
Sandringham.

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:14.819
If we can meet with Sandringham,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.488
convince him this is a bad investment.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.373
<i>What if we host a dinner for the duke?</i>

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.819
<i>No, the duke will want to take
the measure of the prince,</i>

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:23.177
<i>decide if he's a man</i>

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.928
<i>worth staking his fortune
and his life on.</i>

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.730
I've met someone I find most intriguing.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.849
You're speaking of Alex Randall.

00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.184
I couldn't help but fall in love.

00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.685
I need to tell you something.

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:32.943
Jack Randall is alive.

00:00:32.988 --> 00:00:34.938
Now I can be the one to end his life.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.076
- Leave her alone!
- Aah!

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:41.695
_

00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:44.865
Your Highness should not be
subjected to such intemperance.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:46.033
Let us depart.

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:48.535

<i>I hadn't noticed
the noise of the clock</i>

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:43.450
<i>before that evening,</i>

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:47.070

<i>reminding me that Jamie wasn't there.</i>

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:54.161
<i>After our dinner party
disintegrated into a brawl,</i>

00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:57.831
<i>the gens d'armes had come
and arrested everyone.</i>

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.083
<i>But it was all a misunderstanding.</i>

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:03.971
<i>Alex Randall hadn't raped Mary Hawkins,</i>

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:07.090
<i>and Jamie had nothing
to do with any of it.</i>

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:23.240
Have you sat up all night long, then?

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:27.077
I'm not the only one.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.033
- He just fell asleep.
- Hmm.

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:47.047
Come on, laddie.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.184
You did well guarding your mistress.

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.239
Duverney arrived and...

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.408
and ordered the Captain of the Guard

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.910
to release us at once.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.214
It's fortunate to have
friends in high places.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.001
Aye.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:29.256
Are you all right?

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:31.475
Yes, we're fine...

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.894
now that you're home.

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:36.063
What about Murtagh and Alex?

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:38.482
Murtagh's downstairs

00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:41.902
washing off the stench
of a French prison.

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:43.353
Alex...

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.573
he didna fare so well.

00:04:46.608 --> 00:04:50.243
Silas claims he saw Alex attack Mary.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:54.414
His release will... will require
word from the lass herself.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.167
We have to help him, Jamie.

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.453
You saw how he came to Mary's aid.

00:04:59.455 --> 00:05:03.507
He's not his brother.

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:05.959
Can't the duke vouch for him?

00:05:05.961 --> 00:05:07.928
Sandringham will let Alex rot

00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:09.546
before he lifts a finger to help.

00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:12.966
Now his secretary's been
publicly disgraced.

00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:16.019
He's already sent a
dispatch to the Bastille

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.055
releasing Alex from his service.

00:05:18.107 --> 00:05:21.141
Well, hopefully he'll have
the same opinion of Charles.

00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:24.311
The duke was watching the
prince during dinner.

00:05:24.313 --> 00:05:26.480
I think he sees him for the...

00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:28.982
the poor investment that he is.

00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:32.986
Well, unfortunately, the
prince left with St. Germain.

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:36.373
No good can come from that pairing.

00:05:38.293 --> 00:05:42.245
I'll set Murtagh to follow St.
Germain...

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:45.082
see if there's anything amiss.

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:47.806
If St. Germain is
responsible for the attack,

00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.052
then we'll find out.

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.340
Can ye remember anything more about it?

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:56.226
Just that they spoke
French like aristocrats,

00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:59.012
wore fine clothes and shoes.

00:05:59.064 --> 00:06:00.313
How did ye escape?

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.399
They mistook me for some

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:06.486
mythical creature named <i>La Dame Blanche.</i>

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:09.439
Fergus said it's some
sorceress nonsense.

00:06:12.528 --> 00:06:15.195
Have you heard of it?

00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:17.330
Yeah.

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:21.284
I may have once mentioned that...

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:24.121
that I was married to<i> La Dame Blanche.</i>

00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:26.173
You did what?

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:28.258
At Maison Elise.

00:06:28.293 --> 00:06:31.094
Charles was pushing yet
more trollops into my lap.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.214
I wanted to stay true to
you, but not appear unmanly.

00:06:35.717 --> 00:06:39.436
And so calling your wife a
witch was your best idea?

00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.638
After everything that
happened at Cranesmuir?

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.106
Now, there may have been

00:06:43.142 --> 00:06:44.391
a fair amount of drinking involved.

00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:46.026
How many people heard you?

00:06:46.061 --> 00:06:48.228
Only a few, but I guess it was

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.614
a good bit of gossip to share.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.316
Oh, I suppose the
assailants were customers

00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:56.453
at... at Maison Elise.

00:06:56.488 --> 00:06:58.955
Aye.

00:06:58.991 --> 00:07:01.208
Aye, and if we find them,

00:07:01.243 --> 00:07:05.212
they may lead us to St. Germain.

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:07.714
Heaven help him if he's responsible.

00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:14.421
It's been a long night for all of us.

00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:16.673
Aye.

00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:19.259
And all I wish for

00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:22.312
is for you to lay in my arms.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.068
<i>La Dame Blanche.</i>

00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:41.364
Monsieur, restock the Belle Rouge

00:07:41.416 --> 00:07:44.167
by the south wall.

00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:47.087
St. Germain was easy
enough to track, but...

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:49.339
I see nothing suspicious.

00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:52.259
Did you learn anything at Maison Elise?

00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:54.628
A wench there told me
of several customers...

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.379
members of a gang,

00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:57.764
masked men

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:01.468
called "Les Disciples"...

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.554
aristocrats that prowl the
streets in search of prey.

00:08:08.277 --> 00:08:10.443
Claire did say the assailants

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.479
were well-spoken and wore fine clothes.

00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:14.731
- Aye.

00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:17.234
And the way into this gang?

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:21.204
A maidenhead.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.625
Mary was a virgin, was she not?

00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:26.626
- Aye.

00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:29.478
_

00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:31.025
_

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:33.135
_

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.556
_

00:08:37.756 --> 00:08:40.173
Ye look like a right clarty midden.

00:08:43.312 --> 00:08:45.595
Go get some sleep, man.

00:08:53.438 --> 00:08:55.605
What is it?

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:59.659
I failed you.

00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:00.944
I...

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:05.332
Ye did no such thing.

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:07.667
Ye gave me yer trust...

00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:11.871
yer wife and yer child
unborn to guard...

00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:13.707
and that wee English lassie.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:17.677
You were outmanned.

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:20.764
I canna forgive myself for
what happened in that alley...

00:09:24.636 --> 00:09:27.220
Or what could have happened.

00:09:28.774 --> 00:09:30.607
Then you keep after him.

00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:40.450
If St. Germain is behind this...

00:09:40.485 --> 00:09:43.703
then we need to connect him
to the gang, Les Disciples.

00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:52.796
I will lay just vengeance at your feet

00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:54.547
or be damned.

00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:11.481
Claire!

00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:19.823
Uncle Silas allowed you in?

00:10:19.858 --> 00:10:22.242
No, he doesn't know I'm here.

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:23.660
I was able to convince your aunt

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:26.363
it's important I give you
a medical examination.

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:29.699
He refuses to let me out the house.

00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:34.337
And he's insisting I l-leave
Paris once I recover.

00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:39.926
I was relieved to hear

00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:42.629
about Jamie and Murtagh being released.

00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:44.964
But will you do me the
favor of delivering this

00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:48.551
to the authorities at the Bastille?

00:10:48.603 --> 00:10:52.772
It's details of the attack...

00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:57.527
explaining Alex's innocence.

00:10:57.562 --> 00:11:00.313
I'll see it gets delivered at once.

00:11:00.315 --> 00:11:02.866
T-thank you.

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.535
Alex is a good man...

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.321
with a kind heart.

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:12.709
You, of course, know of
my fondness for him.

00:11:12.744 --> 00:11:14.411
I understand.

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:19.999
Now...

00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:22.001
how are you feeling?

00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:25.505
Ashamed.

00:11:27.843 --> 00:11:31.761
Like I'm a different person now...

00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:35.849
and I'll never be the same.

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:40.770
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:11:40.822 --> 00:11:42.772
What happened was not your fault.

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:51.581
How are you feeling physically?

00:11:51.616 --> 00:11:53.533
I bled a bit,

00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:56.286
but it stopped.

00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:59.839
Good. That's normal.

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:04.377
And I brought you some herbs to help.

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:06.880
They're to be brewed in hot water.

00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:12.435
And once the infusion cools,

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.605
then you can apply it with a cloth.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.558
Am I going to have a baby?

00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:25.865
No.

00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:32.405
I don't believe so.

00:12:32.457 --> 00:12:35.458
He... your attacker...

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:40.079
He wasn't able to finish.

00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:51.591
I'm so grateful for all
you've done, Claire.

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:54.394
At least... at least now

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:57.897
they can't force me to
marry that dreadful man,

00:12:57.933 --> 00:13:00.767
The Vicomte.

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:05.522
Uncle says he'd n-never
take a soiled bride.

00:13:05.574 --> 00:13:07.941
Well, good riddance.

00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:10.159
You are far too pretty,

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:12.445
not to mention sweet,

00:13:12.447 --> 00:13:17.083
to marry such a warty old man.

00:13:17.118 --> 00:13:21.120
I-I just know that once Alex is freed,

00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:23.590
he'll return to me.

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.625
We're hoping to be married.

00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.965
<i>Marriage?</i>

00:13:32.017 --> 00:13:34.801
<i>When Mary mentioned Alex
Randall at the hospital,</i>

00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:39.522
<i>I thought it nothing more
than a young girl's crush.</i>

00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:41.608
<i>If Alex and Mary were to wed,</i>

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:43.059
<i>what would become of the lineage</i>

00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:47.146
<i>Mary and Jack Randall supposedly ensure?</i>

00:13:47.148 --> 00:13:49.649
<i>What becomes of Frank?</i>

00:14:01.546 --> 00:14:04.080
<i>Did I hold the key to Frank's existence</i>

00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:07.166
<i>in the palm of my hand?</i>

00:14:07.218 --> 00:14:09.586
<i>Could I simply release my grasp,</i>

00:14:09.638 --> 00:14:10.970
<i>dispose of the letter,</i>

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:14.757
<i>and allow fate to carry out its plan?</i>

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.510
<i>But how could I condemn
Alex Randall to prison</i>

00:14:17.562 --> 00:14:19.012
<i>without the utmost certainty</i>

00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:21.731
<i>it would ensure Frank's existence?</i>

00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:28.021
James, my good man.

00:14:28.023 --> 00:14:30.023
Your Royal Highness.

00:14:34.913 --> 00:14:37.780
The female haze that
once clouded my mind

00:14:37.832 --> 00:14:39.749
has been lifted.

00:14:39.784 --> 00:14:41.584
I have excellent news.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.038
Open your finest bottle of Burgundy.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.506
Aye.

00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.925
Uh...

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.011
is this to do with your investors?

00:14:52.047 --> 00:14:55.598
Make no mention of those scoundrels.

00:14:55.634 --> 00:14:59.769
They have shown their true colors.

00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:01.304
What if I were to tell you

00:15:01.356 --> 00:15:05.692
we were about to come into
possession of 10,000 pounds...

00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:10.563
Sterling?

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:13.316
I'd say this is what
we've been waiting for.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.738
I have dispatched a letter to my father

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.791
informing him of our good fortune.

00:15:21.826 --> 00:15:23.826
Mark me, James,

00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:26.079
the king has led a dolorous life

00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:28.831
full of misfortune.

00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:32.802
And now I stand poised
to lay at his feet

00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:35.805
the world's most treasured gift...

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.811
The throne of Britain.

00:15:47.018 --> 00:15:50.737
And, uh, who is it...

00:15:50.772 --> 00:15:52.605
that offers such a prize?

00:15:52.657 --> 00:15:55.608
The Comte St. Germain.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.326
He wishes to buy a large shipment

00:15:57.362 --> 00:15:59.746
of Portuguese Madeira.

00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.031
However, the comte is short of funds

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:05.451
and in desperate need
of a business partner.

00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:17.764
And what does the comte require?

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:20.717
I've secured a bank loan
to provide half the funds

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:22.635
to buy the shipment.

00:16:22.637 --> 00:16:24.270
Once we sell the wine,

00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:27.306
we'll earn ourselves a rich profit.

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:35.314
But not enough to finance an army.

00:16:35.316 --> 00:16:38.234
But enough to begin securing ships,

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:43.156
weapons, fighting men
for our holy cause.

00:16:43.158 --> 00:16:46.292
And when your friend Duverney
hears what we will accomplish,

00:16:46.327 --> 00:16:48.044
he'll have proof for the king

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.713
that it's a worthy investment.

00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:54.667
And with French money,
we will unite the clans,

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:59.422
and I will lead you all
to the gates of London

00:16:59.474 --> 00:17:01.307
and to glory.

00:17:07.766 --> 00:17:10.183
Good news indeed.

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:16.689
Although the, uh...

00:17:16.691 --> 00:17:19.075
the thought of a partnership

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.110
with St. Germain

00:17:21.162 --> 00:17:22.862
does leave me uneasy.

00:17:22.914 --> 00:17:24.697
I am no fool, James.

00:17:24.749 --> 00:17:27.700
I am well aware of his
damnable reputation.

00:17:27.702 --> 00:17:31.254
Well, you've heard he's said
to dwell in heretical circles.

00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:34.257
They talk of demonic rituals.

00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:36.459
Rumor and innuendo.

00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:38.461
I pay no more attention to that

00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:42.215
than I do to the rumors
about your wife...

00:17:42.217 --> 00:17:44.267
<i>La Dame Blanche.</i>

00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:47.053
Huh.

00:17:47.105 --> 00:17:50.106
St. Germain is no lover of my cause,

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:53.309
but he is a man of business.

00:17:53.361 --> 00:17:55.278
And I have arranged for you

00:17:55.313 --> 00:17:57.196
to be the one to sell the wine.

00:17:57.232 --> 00:17:58.865
Me?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.366
Oh, who better than you

00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:03.236
to secure the buyer and keep a wary eye

00:18:03.288 --> 00:18:07.290
on St. Germain?

00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:11.327
Well, when are we to
expect this shipment?

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:15.131
Do not plague me with
workmen's concerns.

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:17.166
I have arranged for you and St. Germain

00:18:17.218 --> 00:18:19.886
to meet in Maison Elise
to discuss particulars.

00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:28.761
To the glorious day
when the rightful king

00:18:28.763 --> 00:18:31.764
sits upon the British throne once more.

00:18:36.354 --> 00:18:38.771
The glorious day.

00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:42.825
I cannot fully express
my gratitude to you

00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:44.110
for your help.

00:18:44.162 --> 00:18:47.580
The Bastille was a
frightening experience.

00:18:47.615 --> 00:18:50.583
I'm sure it was.

00:18:50.618 --> 00:18:54.370
Mary tells me of your plans to wed.

00:18:54.422 --> 00:18:56.255
Yes. Isn't it wonderful?

00:18:56.291 --> 00:18:59.258
Of course.

00:18:59.294 --> 00:19:02.178
However, I am concerned
about your ability

00:19:02.213 --> 00:19:04.180
to find a new position in Paris

00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:07.884
now that the duke has discharged
you from his service.

00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:19.278
Beg your pardon.

00:19:23.902 --> 00:19:25.952
You are unwell, Alex,

00:19:25.987 --> 00:19:28.287
and your condition has
not improved with time.

00:19:28.323 --> 00:19:31.290
Surely you wouldn't want
Mary robbed of her youth

00:19:31.326 --> 00:19:32.825
playing nurse.

00:19:32.877 --> 00:19:34.327
Of course not.

00:19:37.248 --> 00:19:39.548
Mary's my friend,

00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:43.502
and she's young and impressionable.

00:19:43.504 --> 00:19:48.007
My concern is for her well-being...

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.092
a concern I trust you share,

00:19:50.144 --> 00:19:52.345
but perhaps you should consider

00:19:52.347 --> 00:19:54.897
what kind of life it is
you're offering her.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:56.933
But of course.

00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:04.073
Then you should set aside your feelings.

00:20:04.108 --> 00:20:08.077
I fear traveling from city to city,

00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:09.362
seeking a new position,

00:20:09.414 --> 00:20:13.582
living a hand-to-mouth existence is...

00:20:13.618 --> 00:20:17.453
well, it's not the future that
Mary has envisioned for herself.

00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:20.506
You have to think what's best for Mary.

00:20:24.379 --> 00:20:27.380
Condemning Mary to a life of penury

00:20:27.432 --> 00:20:29.548
is something I wouldn't dream of.

00:20:32.437 --> 00:20:33.936
I love her enough

00:20:33.972 --> 00:20:36.639
to want her to have the
future she deserves.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.029
She's going to be devastated, you know.

00:20:43.064 --> 00:20:45.064
Yes, she will.

00:20:47.702 --> 00:20:50.486
She loves you very much.

00:20:53.124 --> 00:20:55.374
But in time,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.961
she will move on from this.

00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:02.274
Thank you for your
candor, Madame Fraser.

00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:05.449
Mary is fortunate to have a friend

00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.941
as caring as you.

00:21:19.267 --> 00:21:21.600
<i>It broke my heart to break his.</i>

00:21:21.652 --> 00:21:24.437
<i>Alex and Mary clearly loved one another,</i>

00:21:24.439 --> 00:21:27.356
<i>and I was robbing them of happiness.</i>

00:21:27.408 --> 00:21:31.327
<i>But what choice did I have?</i>

00:21:31.362 --> 00:21:34.413
<i>I forced myself to
focus on the evidence.</i>

00:21:34.449 --> 00:21:36.665
<i>Mary Hawkins and Jonathan Randall</i>

00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:38.617
<i>were to have a child together.</i>

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:42.705
<i>I saw the proof of
that with my own eyes.</i>

00:21:42.757 --> 00:21:46.125
<i>Alex and Mary simply could not be...</i>

00:21:46.127 --> 00:21:49.261
<i>for Frank's sake.</i>

00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:01.942

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:11.034
_

00:22:16.574 --> 00:22:18.991
I don't wish to be joined
together in business,

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:21.660
nor do I wish to sit in your
presence longer than is needed,

00:22:21.712 --> 00:22:24.130
so let's just get on with it, shall we?

00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:25.213

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.791

_

00:22:39.764 --> 00:22:42.398
Since you brought up my wife,
let me make this clear...

00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:44.150
someone tried to poison her

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:45.734
and attacked her in the street,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.736
then raped her friend.

00:22:49.857 --> 00:22:53.826
My memory is as long as yours.

00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:57.627
When I find the man responsible,

00:22:57.753 --> 00:22:59.886
he'll die a very slow
and very painful death.

00:23:03.658 --> 00:23:06.338
_

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.666

<i>If this wine venture is successful</i>

and the prince manages to
secure other investors,

00:23:48.792 --> 00:23:51.209
I have no doubt he'll set sail
for Scotland straightaway.

00:23:51.211 --> 00:23:53.928
Well, then it's simple:

00:23:53.963 --> 00:23:56.514
Charles must not get his
hands on that money.

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:58.216
Somehow we have to find a way

00:23:58.218 --> 00:24:00.661
to dispose of that
shipment before it's sold.

00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:02.403
Maybe St. Germain will do us a wee favor

00:24:02.437 --> 00:24:05.188
and bring in another ship
infected with smallpox.

00:24:10.195 --> 00:24:11.160
Huh.

00:24:11.196 --> 00:24:13.079
I ken that look, Sassenach.

00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:15.281
I was merely joking about the smallpox.

00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:17.200
Well, I'm not.

00:24:17.202 --> 00:24:19.502
Ye happen to have a-a bottle of it

00:24:19.537 --> 00:24:21.421
amongst yer potions, do ye?

00:24:21.456 --> 00:24:24.090
No, not the actual disease.

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.342
But there are herbs that can
be used to make it appear

00:24:26.378 --> 00:24:29.429
as though smallpox is present in St.
Germain's crew,

00:24:29.464 --> 00:24:31.431
convince everyone the shipment's tainted

00:24:31.466 --> 00:24:33.132
and have it destroyed.

00:24:33.184 --> 00:24:35.518
Is such a thing even possible?

00:24:35.554 --> 00:24:37.221
I'm not sure.

00:24:37.272 --> 00:24:38.873
I'll look into it tomorrow.

00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:40.861
Huh.

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:44.447
Well, don't forget we're
due at the royal stables.

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.666
I agreed to help the duke

00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:48.418
with the purchase of a team of horses.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.787
- Oh, that's tomorrow?
- Aye.

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:52.288
You don't owe that man

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.007
any favors, Jamie.

00:24:54.043 --> 00:24:57.094
And neither do I wish to be
the subject of his disfavor.

00:24:57.129 --> 00:24:59.796
Hmm.

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:07.053
I've been waiting for a good time

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:10.473
to surprise ye with this.

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:22.402
What is it?

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.454
Sure.

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.083
Apostle spoons...

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:45.508
One for each of the 12 Apostles...

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:51.848
Christening gift for the bairn.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.242
Jamie.

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:05.195
Well, where did you get them?

00:26:05.247 --> 00:26:07.330
Ah.

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:11.367
They've been passed down
in my family for years.

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.870
I wrote to Jenny

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:16.172
after we arrived to
tell her our good news

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:20.126
and to ask for the spoons
for our wee bairn.

00:26:20.395 --> 00:26:23.263
She said she was so full of excitement,

00:26:23.288 --> 00:26:27.073
she could hardly keep the
quill steady in her hand.

00:26:34.609 --> 00:26:36.559
I know it sounds ridiculous,

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:39.395
but I can't help but wondering

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.898
if I'll be any good at it...

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.569
Being a mother.

00:26:49.491 --> 00:26:50.990
Of course you will.

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:57.914
Well, I'm a nurse.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:27:00.917
I know how to deliver a baby,

00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:03.136
how to feed one,

00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:07.590
how to take care of one
when it's ill, but...

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.926
that's not being a mother.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:18.434
I only have a vague memory
of my own mother...

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.570
nothing really to guide me.

00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:30.330
What you don't ken, ye'll learn.

00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:34.200
We'll learn...

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.451
together.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.927
I do love you.

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:46.129
I love you too...

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:22.332
I do miss the smell of the stable.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:25.218
That makes one of us.

00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:29.672
Jamie, lad. Ah, your glowing bride.

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:34.594
My dear, your condition only
enhances your ravishing beauty.

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.179
Oh, I may be ill.

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.598
- Oh.
- It's not contagious.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.017
But if you gentlemen will excuse me...

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:51.244
Aye, now there's a bonny lad.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:57.417
Fair, strong back,

00:28:57.452 --> 00:29:01.371
straight-legged...

00:29:01.423 --> 00:29:03.373
sound at the hip.

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:06.209
Aye. Aye, he's grand, Your Grace.

00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:09.095
Excellent. Well, let's take him.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.131
I was very displeased to
hear of your legal woes,

00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:14.050
especially after such a lovely dinner.

00:29:14.102 --> 00:29:18.271
The Bastille, perish the thought.

00:29:18.306 --> 00:29:21.057
This one...

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.559
dull in the eye and splints.

00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:26.696
Pass.

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.398
I wasn't at the Bastille for long,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.367
but other poor devils have
been there for decades.

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.738
Ah, well, life can be harsh.

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.218
Madame Broch Tuarach...

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.753
_

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.794
_

00:29:55.051 --> 00:29:57.918
_

00:29:57.943 --> 00:29:59.590
_

00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:02.715
_

00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:13.239
_

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.495
<i>Merci.</i>

00:30:25.673 --> 00:30:27.623
It may be some small
consolation to you to know

00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:30.460
that your dinner party
was not entirely wasted.

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:34.430
It allowed me to take the
measure of your prince.

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:37.216
And what was your assessment?

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:38.634
My considered opinion?

00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:41.354
He's an utter ass.

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:44.690
I'm sorry to hear yer opinion
of the prince is such.

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:46.392
I imagine you are,

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:49.112
especially since you seem
to have pledged yourself

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:52.115
to his service.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.368
They claim they're
three-year-olds, but...

00:30:55.403 --> 00:31:00.289
oh, this one's seen a
fair few seasons more.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.458
Your knowledge astounds me.

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.460
But I wonder that someone

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:07.413
who's such a good judge of horseflesh

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.715
is such a poor judge of men.

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:16.639
I see the prince for what he is,

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.559
but his father is the true king.

00:31:19.594 --> 00:31:21.594
Nobly said.

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:28.484
Ah, now here's a fine stallion...
well put together.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.237
Oh, it's magnificent.

00:31:31.272 --> 00:31:32.522
My word.

00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:34.941
But I must see a few more.

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:38.528
I'm a man who cherishes options.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.746
Don't you?

00:31:53.294 --> 00:31:56.879
Tell me, you have lived in Scotland.

00:31:56.931 --> 00:32:01.601
Do you find life there to be simpler?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.687
In some ways.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.389
Not in others.

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:10.476
The politics and manipulations
among the clans and lads

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:13.529
can sometimes rival even the
intrigues of Versailles.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.482
James was never a man for intrigue...

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.401
at least not in those days.

00:32:18.453 --> 00:32:22.288
He was direct, honest, simple.

00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:23.873
I wouldn't call Jamie simple.

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:26.742
Not today.

00:32:26.794 --> 00:32:29.745
Now he's a man of business...

00:32:29.797 --> 00:32:31.464
of politics...

00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:34.634
Like all the others.

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:37.386
It saddens me to think of him like that.

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.971
He's still Jamie.

00:32:39.007 --> 00:32:41.974
I doubt he will ever lose sight
of who he truly is at heart.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.894
When I knew him, he was impulsive,

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:46.312
headstrong.

00:32:46.347 --> 00:32:49.732
He still is.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:53.402
Ah, but when I knew him, he was a boy.

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:57.440
You've turned him into a man.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.408
Speaking of men,

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:04.080
there's a rather dashing one
over there staring at us.

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.415
He seems quite taken with you.

00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:28.604
Claire?

00:33:31.811 --> 00:33:35.029
I take it you two are... acquainted?

00:33:36.564 --> 00:33:38.781
Yes.

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.733
Yes, we are.

00:33:45.847 --> 00:33:47.824
_

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:50.378
_

00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:54.768
_

00:33:55.854 --> 00:33:57.854
_

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:00.753
_

00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:04.150
_

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.928
Are you in discomfort, Captain?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.682
I met with an accident some time ago.

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.943
I'm sorry, Annalise.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:26.829
Suddenly I'm feeling very unwell.

00:34:27.332 --> 00:34:28.415
I-I should go.

00:34:28.534 --> 00:34:30.116
I will call for your husband.

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.368
No, it's not necessary.

00:34:34.088 --> 00:34:36.088
Jamie?

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:42.044
He's here?

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:47.883
Where?

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.885
You should go.

00:34:49.937 --> 00:34:51.604
If he sees you, he will cut your throat.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.139
That would be a lethal mistake.

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.141
Drawing a sword in the
presence of the king

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:56.892
is punishable by death.

00:35:04.986 --> 00:35:08.154
This is unbelievable.

00:35:10.658 --> 00:35:13.159
The fates are toying with us now,

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.995
setting our feet on
seemingly divergent paths

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:18.164
that still somehow converge

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:23.002
in the most unlikely of places.

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:27.640
Get out of my way.

00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:29.675
Claire, surely you of all people

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:32.061
can step outside the
passions of the moment

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:34.680
and appreciate the
sublime preposterousness

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.982
of a universe that would
guide us to a meeting...

00:35:37.018 --> 00:35:39.235
at the French court.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.940
Let go of me.

00:35:47.495 --> 00:35:48.744
The king?

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.913
Fuck the king.

00:36:02.605 --> 00:36:06.410
_

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.691
_

00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:15.145
_

00:36:15.426 --> 00:36:17.535
_

00:36:17.644 --> 00:36:20.644
_

00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:22.589
_

00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:24.340
_

00:36:25.098 --> 00:36:26.887
_

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:29.239
_

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.764
_

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:39.295
You will forgive the rudeness
of these children, Captain.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.915
The French language is not
easily mastered by the English.

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.751
I took no offense, sire.

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:50.089
Oh, but perhaps the king
himself has offended you,

00:36:50.142 --> 00:36:52.142
Madame Fraser?

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.106
_

00:36:55.472 --> 00:36:56.269
_

00:36:56.488 --> 00:36:58.957
_

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:06.355
The king admires your
uniform, Captain...

00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:10.109
so seldom seen at this court.

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:12.745
Such bold colors

00:37:12.781 --> 00:37:15.782
as befit the brave soldiers
of your sovereign.

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:20.169
A pity that your countrymen
are usually too busy

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:23.839
slaughtering each other to
exchange such pleasantries.

00:37:26.878 --> 00:37:30.846
Uh, speaking as a soldier of
many years, Your Majesty,

00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:34.884
I must say that I find war
preferable to politics.

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:38.053
At least in war, you know your enemies.

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:41.974
Hmm, the king finds some
truth in what you say.

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:46.862
However, we hope your
affection for carnage

00:37:46.898 --> 00:37:49.899
does not ultimately prove fatal for you.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:58.207
You and the Captain are friends, Madame?

00:37:58.242 --> 00:37:59.875
We are acquainted.

00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:04.747
Hmm, does that not present
difficulty with your husband?

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:07.416
He is, after all, a
proud Scottish warrior

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:10.002
and great supporter of my
cousin's rightful claim

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:12.221
to the British throne.

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:15.841
Or perhaps you have not
met Lord Broch Tuarach?

00:38:25.987 --> 00:38:29.104
Captain Randall and I have met
several times, Your Majesty.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.109
Are you well, Captain?

00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:36.161
Very well, sir. Thank you.

00:38:36.197 --> 00:38:39.949
I hear you had a... an unfortunate
encounter with some...

00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:42.418
sheep, was it?

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.253
Uh, cattle, actually.

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:47.089
Ah, but now
you've quite recovered.

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:50.426
Mostly. I still have a little difficulty

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.177
getting out of bed on cold mornings.

00:38:52.213 --> 00:38:55.214
Really? I understand the
weather here in Paris

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.967
is to be quite warm all week.

00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:00.135
You need to have no concern
for my health, then.

00:39:00.187 --> 00:39:02.221
Delighted to hear it.

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:05.975
Tell us, Captain...

00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:09.311
why are you here?

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:14.066
I am, in fact, here on an errand
of mercy to aid my brother.

00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:18.737
Your Majesty, until recently,

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:21.957
my brother was in the employ
of the duke of Sandringham.

00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:24.243
I have come here to ask His Grace

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:27.162
to reconsider his position.

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:29.164
Perhaps you should beg.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.504
Uh, beg, Your Majesty?

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:39.308
Yes. On your knees.

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.844
To ask such a favor of
a man like the duke

00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:43.345
would not be possible.

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:47.149
To beg him, however, that
is a different matter.

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:53.022
On your knees.

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:26.855
Not now.

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:30.225
You English are so...

00:40:30.277 --> 00:40:31.393
literal.

00:40:35.723 --> 00:40:37.174
_

00:40:38.748 --> 00:40:40.333
_

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.806
_

00:40:41.862 --> 00:40:44.708
_

00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:47.282
Of course. _

00:40:48.577 --> 00:40:49.883
_

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:56.251
You may retire as well,
Lord Broch Tuarach.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:04.226
The king gives you leave to rise.

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:09.014
It would be a shame to stain
such pretty britches.

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:20.075
Are you really unwell, Sassenach?

00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.193
Is it the bairn?

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:22.611
No, I'm fine.

00:41:22.663 --> 00:41:24.113
You sure?

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:25.948
Yes, I just wanted us to get away...

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.282
All right.

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:29.501
Wait here.

00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:30.953
Jamie.

00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:07.322
What just happened?

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:11.044
I challenged him to a
duel, and he accepted.

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:14.046
He said he owed me a death.

00:42:43.277 --> 00:42:45.994
- It's a great day, laddie.
- Is it?

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.113
Oh, you have no idea.
Fetch Murtagh at once.

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.998
Yes, milord.

00:42:51.788 --> 00:42:54.508
_

00:42:58.425 --> 00:43:01.426
I'll arrange the particulars
with his second.

00:43:01.462 --> 00:43:03.712
As the challenged, Randall
selects the weapons.

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.214
Aye.

00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:07.182
And what if it's pistols?

00:43:07.218 --> 00:43:08.634
What then?

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:12.354
He'll not take pistols.

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:16.191
It's too quick, too far apart.

00:43:16.227 --> 00:43:18.477
He'll want to look me in the eye.

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:22.531
Aye, but don't err in
judging the man's skills.

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:25.400
You don't become Captain of Dragoons

00:43:25.452 --> 00:43:27.202
unless you know how to handle a blade.

00:43:27.238 --> 00:43:28.237
Hmm.

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:31.240
There won't be any duel.

00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:36.078
Randall is locked away in the Bastille.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.297
On what charge?

00:43:38.332 --> 00:43:41.550
I swore an accusation against him...

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:44.753
that he was the one who
attacked Mary and me.

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.388
Christ, woman, what have ye done?

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:48.223
- Murtagh, please.
- Have you lost your mind?

00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:50.642
Swearing a false charge?

00:43:50.678 --> 00:43:53.428
They won't be able to hold him for long,

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:57.266
and I'll say I must have been mistaken.

00:43:57.268 --> 00:43:59.101
But it's long enough to
get you to listen to me.

00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:00.652
Jamie, you can't go through with this.

00:44:00.688 --> 00:44:02.571
Why would you do such a thing, Claire?

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:04.740
Because dueling is outlawed in France.

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.325
And if you're caught, you could spend

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.110
the rest of your life
behind bars or worse.

00:44:08.162 --> 00:44:09.778
I won't risk that.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.530
You are about to become a father.

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.582
You have to think of me and your child.

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:15.534
No. No, there are places in the city

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.252
where the gens d'armes are not present.

00:44:17.288 --> 00:44:19.121
He won't get caught. I'll see to it.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:21.423
Murtagh, will you please leave?

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.292
This is between Jamie and me.

00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:39.609
You gave me a gift, Claire...

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:42.477
when you told me Randall was alive.

00:44:42.529 --> 00:44:45.230
A gift...

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:49.868
knowing I'd be the one to
end that bastard's life.

00:44:49.904 --> 00:44:52.404
No.

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:55.374
Now I claim that gift.

00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:58.744
Please, listen to me, Jamie.

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.662
You can't kill Randall.

00:45:00.714 --> 00:45:01.880
There's no reason.

00:45:01.916 --> 00:45:03.665
Because of Frank.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.719
Frank?

00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:13.425
If you kill Randall now, then Frank...

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.427
he won't be born.

00:45:17.564 --> 00:45:21.266
W-what do you mean?

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:24.186
Remember I told you once

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:26.688
that Frank showed me his family tree

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.191
and on it was the name Jack Randall?

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:32.828
Aye.

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:36.248
He married Mary Hawkins.

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:40.369
Together they're supposed
to have a child,

00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.205
and that child is Frank's ancestor.

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:47.709
But if you kill Randall
before the child is born,

00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:50.762
then it would be as if
you're killing Frank too.

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:57.719
And he won't exist, and he must exist.

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.606
It's part of the future.

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:10.615
I thought we were here
to change the future.

00:46:10.651 --> 00:46:13.235
Frank's innocent in all of this.

00:46:13.287 --> 00:46:15.404
You can't kill an innocent man.

00:46:15.406 --> 00:46:16.621
"Innocent"?

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.460
He's committed no crime
against either of us.

00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:24.963
For that, Jack Randall should live?

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.334
I-I can stand a lot, more than most.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:31.920
I've proven as much.

00:46:31.972 --> 00:46:34.840
But must I bear everyone's weakness?

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:37.259
May I not have my own?

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:44.266
You of all people canna
expect that of me, Claire.

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.851
You were there. You saw
what he did to me.

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:49.938
- A delay, a delay is all I ask.
- No.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.275
No, you have your choice... him or me?

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:56.828
I canna live while Randall lives.

00:46:56.864 --> 00:46:59.281
If you wilna allow me to kill him,

00:46:59.333 --> 00:47:01.500
then kill me now yerself.

00:47:04.371 --> 00:47:06.455
One year.

00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:09.374
One year.

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:12.344
T-the... Then the child, Randall's,

00:47:12.379 --> 00:47:13.595
it will be conceived by then,

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:15.515
and after that, I swear...

00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:17.799
I swear I will help
you bleed him myself.

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:25.390
You owe me that much, James Fraser.

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:29.811
I've saved your life,
not once, but twice.

00:47:29.863 --> 00:47:32.981
You owe me a life.

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:40.989
I see.

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:45.544
And now you claim your debt.

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:47.996
I can't make you see
reason any other way.

00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:51.000
Jesus.

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:53.885
God, Claire.

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.006
You'd stop me taking vengeance

00:47:58.058 --> 00:48:01.760
on the man that made
me play his whore...

00:48:05.065 --> 00:48:07.983
The man that lived in my nightmares

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.684
and in our bed...

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:14.489
Who almost drove me to take my own life.

00:48:21.448 --> 00:48:23.448
I'm a man of honor.

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:28.036
I pay my debts.

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.754
So tell me now,

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.958
is that what you're asking of me?

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:36.678
To pay you with the life
of Black Jack Randall?

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.052
Yes.

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:20.805
A year...

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:30.015
Not one day more.

00:49:30.068 --> 00:49:32.685
Do not...

00:49:32.737 --> 00:49:34.437
touch me.

00:49:47.346 --> 00:49:49.500
