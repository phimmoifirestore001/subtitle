00:12:56.486 --> 00:12:58.093
You cannot blame them for gawking.

00:12:58.094 --> 00:13:00.512
Dueling is outlawed in France.

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.764
No doubt they think we mean
to run each other through.

00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:04.182
Yet another wrong

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.767
to mark against this
misery of a country.

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:10.238
(EXHALES DEEPLY) Would you look at me?

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:15.110
I'm out of breath already
after hardly an hour.

00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:17.625
It's the air.

00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:19.794
Arses and armpits!

00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:22.463
Too many people.

00:13:22.464 --> 00:13:26.300
Scotland doesn't exactly
smell like a lady's boudoir.

00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:28.853
Aye, but it's an animal smell.

00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:31.354
This city reeks of the chamber pot.

00:13:33.642 --> 00:13:35.609
Don't you miss it, lad...

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.479
the smell of fresh Scottish mud, huh?

00:13:41.283 --> 00:13:44.568
It pains me to admit so,
but I even find myself

00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:48.321
longing for the company of
Lard Bucket and Big Head.

00:13:50.292 --> 00:13:51.742
You mean Rupert and Angus?

00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:53.460
(CHUCKLES)

00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:54.829
Lard Bucket...

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.965
(LAUGHS) Rupert would call it muscle.

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:04.637
But wee Angus does sport
a curiously large head.

00:14:06.424 --> 00:14:08.676
I'm sure they miss your
sunny countenance as well.

00:14:08.677 --> 00:14:10.594
(SPEAKING GAELIC)

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:11.969
We won't be here forever.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.272
No, but it'll seem so.

00:14:18.687 --> 00:14:21.906
I thought we came here
to prevent a rebellion.

00:14:21.907 --> 00:14:24.525
Instead, what have we become...
wine merchants?

00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:26.911
Wine is for drinking, not for selling.

00:14:26.912 --> 00:14:28.612
What would you have me do?

00:14:28.613 --> 00:14:30.998
If you want to kill a snake,
you cut off its head.

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:34.451
And the head of this
rebellion is Charles Stuart.

00:14:34.452 --> 00:14:37.705
Kill The Prince, you kill the rebellion.

00:14:37.706 --> 00:14:39.157
I'm no assassin.

00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:43.663
No, but I'm betting there
are plenty round here

00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:46.680
willing to earn that title
for a handful of coin.

00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:49.466
We don't even know for
certain if he's in Paris.

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:51.126
I'll find him. I swear it.

00:14:51.127 --> 00:14:53.140
And then what?

00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:56.548
Charles' death will still leave
his father for us to deal with.

00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:58.916
You propose we do away
with James as well?

00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:00.561
(SIGHS)

00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:04.080
Is your longing for home
worth the murder of a prince

00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:06.606
and The King?

00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:10.454
No, for all we know, the death
of his son would make James

00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:15.042
even more determined to sit
on the English throne.

00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:16.911
I talk of action,

00:15:16.912 --> 00:15:20.080
and you give me logic.

00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:21.563
Aye.

00:15:21.564 --> 00:15:23.584
Well...

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:25.134
if it's action you crave...

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:30.139
(SPEAKING GAELIC)

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:44.829
How's your hand?

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.449
It's mending.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.618
This arrived for you today in the post.

00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:52.587
It's from Jared.

00:15:52.588 --> 00:15:54.339
Finally.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.507
Hopefully it's good news.

00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:02.296
(SPEAKING GAELIC)

00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.852
Good man.

00:16:07.853 --> 00:16:09.554
Has he arranged an introduction

00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:11.389
with the Jacobite leaders?

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.309
He's done better than that.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.860
"Prince Charles Stuart

00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:17.729

00:16:21.734 --> 00:16:24.569
And Jared suggested
that you meet Charles

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.655
at Maison de Madame Elise.

00:16:26.656 --> 00:16:27.905
What is that?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.826
It's a brothel.

Excuse me.

00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:21.543
Your Royal Highness, if you
will indulge me for a moment,

00:17:21.544 --> 00:17:23.595
I would very much like
to discuss the reason

00:17:23.596 --> 00:17:26.380
for our having this
meeting here tonight.

00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:30.385

James, this is why I admire the French.

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.292
They're so wonderfully vulgar.

00:18:44.293 --> 00:18:46.010
They never allow their exquisite manners

00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:48.680
to interfere with their baser instincts.

00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:51.602
Yeah, they do find unique
ways to enjoy themselves.

00:18:51.603 --> 00:18:54.010

<i>Brave. Brave, bravissime.</i> (APPLAUSE)

00:19:17.993 --> 00:19:19.661
Very clever, indeed.

00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:23.081
Mark me... if I had a wife,

00:19:23.082 --> 00:19:25.333
I'd buy all three...

00:19:25.334 --> 00:19:27.085
for variety. (LAUGHS)

00:19:27.086 --> 00:19:29.387
You ask me, the French are
a sorry bunch of sodomites

00:19:29.388 --> 00:19:30.889
that canna please their women.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.676
Forgive me. I do not
recall asking your opinion

00:19:34.677 --> 00:19:37.060
nor inviting you here this evening.

00:19:39.014 --> 00:19:41.349
Where he goes, I go.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.601
My friend Jared Fraser

00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:46.855
claims you're a man of substance,

00:19:46.856 --> 00:19:49.774
that you speak your true
mind in all matters.

00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:51.776
Mark me...

00:19:51.777 --> 00:19:53.778
I hope it is so.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:58.116
I have no desire to add another
sycophant to my acquaintances.

00:19:58.117 --> 00:20:01.035
I have about me too many already.

00:20:01.036 --> 00:20:03.037
Tell me...

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:07.008
what are the state of
affairs in Scotland?

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:10.929
Are your clans prepared
to hear my call to arms,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.131
rise up against the heretical traitor

00:20:13.132 --> 00:20:15.933
that dares to sit upon
my father's throne?

00:20:17.553 --> 00:20:20.772
You ask of the clans?

00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:24.525
Well, sire, the truth of it is,

00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:28.446
the clans canna agree on
the color of the sky,

00:20:28.447 --> 00:20:31.449
let alone put aside their old
grievances and band together

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.068
to fight the British.

00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:37.121
No, sire...

00:20:37.122 --> 00:20:39.123
they're not ready to hear
the call of the pipes

00:20:39.124 --> 00:20:43.076
nor likely to be so for
many years to come.

00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:47.748
I dare say...

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.589
If that is the truth...

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.925
it is one I have yet to hear.

00:20:56.926 --> 00:20:59.560
Damnable defeatist talk
is what it sounds like

00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:02.931
and very peculiar coming
from a supposed Jacobite.

00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:05.098
- Ooh, monsieur...
- <i> Non, merci.</i>

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.772
I assure you, sire...

00:21:10.773 --> 00:21:14.859
I hate the English as much as any man.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.779
I carry the scars of
200 lashes on my back

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.199
that remind me of the fact every day.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.667
You asked for the truth,

00:21:22.668 --> 00:21:25.169
and the truth is what I gave you.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.788
Would you rather I whispered

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:29.757
honeyed words of
reassurance in your ear,

00:21:29.758 --> 00:21:31.542
words that would lead you...

00:21:31.543 --> 00:21:36.130
lead all of Scotland... to disaster?

00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:39.217
God demands that a Catholic king

00:21:39.218 --> 00:21:42.020
sit on the English throne.

00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:45.139
My father is that king.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.891
I wish for that as well.

00:21:46.892 --> 00:21:48.643
I'm pleased to hear it.

00:21:48.644 --> 00:21:51.145
But wishing...

00:21:51.146 --> 00:21:54.532
has proven time and again to be no match

00:21:54.533 --> 00:21:57.618
for the muskets of the British Army,

00:21:57.619 --> 00:21:59.988
as it did during The Rising of Fifteen.

00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:04.042
I will not repeat the
mistakes of Lord Mar.

00:22:04.043 --> 00:22:06.995
He hesitated when victory
was within his grasp.

00:22:06.996 --> 00:22:10.297
Above all else, a leader
must be decisive.

00:22:17.589 --> 00:22:19.140
May I ask, Your Royal Highness,

00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:22.009
have ye ever been to Scotland?

00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:32.686
I regret having not had the pleasure...

00:22:35.858 --> 00:22:37.742
Having spent my early years in Italy,

00:22:37.743 --> 00:22:40.193
where my father was
forced to seek exile.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.698
Then ken this...

00:22:43.699 --> 00:22:47.168
Scotland is a beautiful country...

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:51.039
its glens, its lochs, its mountains.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.291
We're a people of the land,

00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:57.178
a simple people with no
great love for outsiders.

00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:01.966
We will fight... have fought...
each other more than not.

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:05.053
But you ask us to shed
our blood for what...

00:23:05.054 --> 00:23:09.690
to put a more sympathetic
arse on the English throne?

00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:11.142
Is that cause enough

00:23:11.143 --> 00:23:14.862
for a cotter to exchange
his scythe for a sword,

00:23:14.863 --> 00:23:17.615
to leave his home, his crops,

00:23:17.616 --> 00:23:19.950
and charge into a cannon's blast?

00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:26.207
It would appear you have
now heard the truth

00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:29.743
from two loyal Scots.

00:23:42.424 --> 00:23:44.710
And what about God's truth?

00:23:46.345 --> 00:23:50.097
For His is the only truth
that matters, is it not?

00:23:51.683 --> 00:23:53.210
I tell you both...

00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:57.616
it is God's will that I, Charles Stuart,

00:23:58.022 --> 00:23:59.803
unite the clans.

00:24:00.109 --> 00:24:03.361
It is God's will that I
be the beacon of light,

00:24:03.362 --> 00:24:05.780
for I am, by divine right,

00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:08.415
the outstretched hand of God.

00:24:23.132 --> 00:24:25.433
Our cause shall succeed,

00:24:25.434 --> 00:24:27.885
but it cannot move
forward without money,

00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:29.749
and money it shall have.

00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:32.440
But to get it, we must win the support

00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:34.809
of the French Minister of Finance,

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.977
a certain Joseph Duverney.

00:24:38.491 --> 00:24:41.199
As I am in this country unofficially,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.632
I cannot be received at Court.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.226
But you, my Lord Broch Tuarach...

00:24:52.007 --> 00:24:54.273
You can go in my place.

00:24:55.797 --> 00:24:56.835
Me...

00:24:57.916 --> 00:24:58.890
sire?

00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:02.968
- I see you have the
heart of a true patriot

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:06.140
willing to risk my divine wrath

00:25:06.141 --> 00:25:08.809
in order to safeguard your countrymen.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.507
I can think of no better man to
help me in this time of need.

00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:15.850
Go to the Court of Louis.

00:25:15.851 --> 00:25:17.952
Be my advocate for rebellion...

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.343
for your Prince,

00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:22.710
for the rightful King,

00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:27.077
and for the God that sits
in judgment of us all.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.530
I will...

00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:37.837
Sire.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.554
And now I am in need of a woman...

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:46.213
or maybe two.

00:25:52.938 --> 00:25:54.171
Mark me...

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.109
is she not a rare beauty?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.718
<i>Che bella donna...</i>

00:26:03.232 --> 00:26:06.483
_

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.406
(SIGHS)

00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.671
I'm proud of you, Jamie.

00:26:19.998 --> 00:26:22.416
You spoke your heart
and still won a place

00:26:22.417 --> 00:26:23.749
at The Prince's side.

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:28.172
The man is a blockhead and
a dangerous one, at that.

00:26:28.173 --> 00:26:30.224
He'll get us all killed
if we don't stop him.

00:26:30.225 --> 00:26:31.425
I wouldna trust The Prince

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:33.427
with Lallybroch's vegetable patch,

00:26:33.428 --> 00:26:35.796
let alone the fate of Scotland.

00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:37.710
It was just one meeting.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.999
Charles isn't ready to set sail
for Scotland anytime soon.

00:26:41.436 --> 00:26:43.202
You'll have time to open his ears.

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:45.812
It'll all be for naught, I'm afraid.

00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:48.671
The man won't listen to me nor anyone.

00:26:49.194 --> 00:26:51.616
Charles listens only to God.

00:26:52.948 --> 00:26:54.390
Well, he is right about one thing.

00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:56.413
Wars cost money.

00:26:56.952 --> 00:26:59.648
And without funds, Charles is helpless.

00:27:00.545 --> 00:27:02.089
All we have to do is see to it

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.960
that his war chest remains empty.

00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:06.544
Let's hope the French
Minister of Finance

00:27:06.545 --> 00:27:08.511
knows a bad investment when he sees one.

00:27:12.634 --> 00:27:15.858
If the Scottish rebellion can
be plotted in a French brothel,

00:27:16.438 --> 00:27:18.780
then perhaps it can be
stopped at the French Court.

<i>The next step in the plan</i>

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.898

(SIGHS) Yes, Colette is
a cute little rascal,

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:17.331
but she has a tendency to bite.

00:28:17.332 --> 00:28:20.046
The bite of the man is desirable,

00:28:20.452 --> 00:28:23.536
but the bite of the monkey, not so much.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.007
Mary!

00:28:27.709 --> 00:28:29.296
Mary?

00:28:30.595 --> 00:28:33.264
You fearful little child.

00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:36.577
Stop hiding and come meet a new friend.

00:28:37.052 --> 00:28:38.969
Such annoying girl.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.391
I regret my pledge to her uncle
to chaperone her around Paris.

00:28:43.392 --> 00:28:45.141
Such a bother.

00:28:51.032 --> 00:28:53.234
(SCOFFS) Stop clutching yourself

00:28:53.235 --> 00:28:55.536
as if you were on display
in a slave market.

a fellow Englishwoman,

00:29:16.675 --> 00:29:19.491
Lady Broch Tuarach, Claire Fraser.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.570
M-Mary Hawkins, Madame.

00:29:30.967 --> 00:29:32.951
Mary Hawkins?

00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:36.545
I'm sure I've heard that
name before somewhere.

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:38.764
I don't believe we've met.

00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:42.733
Mm. Well, it will come to me, somehow.

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:46.951
And what brings you to Paris, Mary?

00:29:47.622 --> 00:29:50.508
M-my Uncle Silas Hawkins
is here on business.

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:53.794
Mary's going to wed the
Vicomte Marigny...

a widower of means.

00:29:56.598 --> 00:29:59.600
Why a girl soon to be so wealthy

00:29:59.601 --> 00:30:02.217
cannot even manage a smile is beyond me.

00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:04.688
The Vicomte Marigny.

00:30:04.689 --> 00:30:07.475
Is he the older gentleman
with all the...

Ah, I see.

00:30:15.784 --> 00:30:18.369
And your uncle has
arranged the marriage?

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.998
A most fortunate union, in spite
of the difference in age.

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:24.358
Aah!

You will do no such thing.

00:30:36.638 --> 00:30:39.173
Her legs are hairier than Colette's,

00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:42.176
and no Frenchman will
suffer to bed a monkey.

00:30:51.686 --> 00:30:55.439
Claire, you say you wish to go to Court?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.775
You shall accompany Mary
and me to Versailles.

00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:02.413
Oh. Thank you, Louise.

00:31:02.414 --> 00:31:04.831
Perhaps I can bring my husband.

Has no one told you?

00:31:31.226 --> 00:31:34.631
In Paris, a hairless
mount is de rigueur.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:39.256
and the men find it
absolutely irresistible.

00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:42.570
It's so warm and so comforting

I'm aware of that.

I was there when it happened.

00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:41.979
_

00:49:43.034 --> 00:49:44.658
_

00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:48.713
_

00:49:50.768 --> 00:49:55.995
_

00:49:55.996 --> 00:49:58.747
(LAUGHTER)

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:02.877
_

00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:12.534
_

00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:17.258
_

00:50:51.685 --> 00:50:54.936
_

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.650
Judas!

00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:06.983
You'll pay for yer treachery.

00:51:06.984 --> 00:51:08.901
Murtagh.

00:51:08.902 --> 00:51:11.953
Never draw your weapon in
the presence of the King.

00:51:13.123 --> 00:51:14.573
It is death.

00:51:19.338 --> 00:51:21.736
_

00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:25.802
If that's an apology,
and I do hope it is,

00:51:25.803 --> 00:51:28.754
I accept with all good grace.

00:51:29.973 --> 00:51:32.759
Jamie, dear boy,

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.313
upon my word, I'm delighted to
see you looking so healthy.

00:51:37.314 --> 00:51:41.768
Ah, Mrs. Fraser, what a joyful reunion.

00:51:41.769 --> 00:51:43.603
I wish I could say the same.

00:51:43.604 --> 00:51:45.772
You cut me to the quick.

00:51:45.773 --> 00:51:47.607
But I suppose I deserve it.

00:51:47.608 --> 00:51:49.992
Let me assure you, I had every
intention of delivering

00:51:49.993 --> 00:51:52.195
that Petition of Complaint
to The Court of Sessions,

00:51:52.196 --> 00:51:55.081
as I had pledged to do.

00:51:55.082 --> 00:51:56.949
It was that damned Randall.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:00.203
The brute insisted I
give it to him instead.

00:52:00.204 --> 00:52:02.872
I had no choice whatsoever.

00:52:02.873 --> 00:52:05.207
Will you ever forgive me?

00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:10.797
What's done is done.

00:52:10.798 --> 00:52:12.348
How true.

00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:14.967
What's passed is passed.

00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:17.303
What are you both doing here in France?

00:52:17.304 --> 00:52:20.542
Jamie has been employed
by his cousin Jared.

00:52:21.308 --> 00:52:23.112
The wine merchant?

00:52:23.757 --> 00:52:27.426
What a serendipitous surprise.

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.067
Tomorrow I go back to England.

00:52:31.068 --> 00:52:34.237
But I shall return
shortly, and when I do,

00:52:34.238 --> 00:52:36.823
I should be very interested to sample

00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:39.709
some of that rare Belle Rouge port

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.377
I understand he's stocking.

00:52:41.378 --> 00:52:43.295
I must have a case.

00:52:44.002 --> 00:52:45.533
Hmm. How much?

00:52:45.534 --> 00:52:49.440
I'd be willing to pay 20%
over the asking price.

00:52:50.131 --> 00:52:51.580
Sold.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.091
On credit, no doubt.

00:52:55.092 --> 00:52:57.176
Jamie, why don't you take
Murtagh to have a drink

00:52:57.177 --> 00:53:00.315
with our new friend, the
Minister of Finance?

00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:23.336
I see you're already
cultivating important people

00:53:23.337 --> 00:53:25.338
in high places.

00:53:25.339 --> 00:53:28.675
How very in keeping with your character.

00:53:29.126 --> 00:53:32.461
Poor Jamie, he must be
missing Scotland terribly.

00:53:32.462 --> 00:53:36.487
I suppose it's no longer a
safe haven for either of you.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.284
Hmm.

00:53:39.303 --> 00:53:40.667
Yes...

00:53:41.471 --> 00:53:43.268
and so here we all are...

00:53:44.441 --> 00:53:46.448
on the same side, no less...

00:53:47.606 --> 00:53:50.690
all supporters of the Jacobite cause.

00:53:51.038 --> 00:53:55.451
Of course, you being
an English aristocrat,

00:53:55.452 --> 00:53:59.989
that position makes you
a traitor to the Crown.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.458
I see time has done nothing

00:54:02.459 --> 00:54:06.044
to dull the sharpness
of your tongue, Madame.

00:54:11.084 --> 00:54:14.253
Your Grace, uh, the fireworks
are due to begin in a moment.

00:54:14.254 --> 00:54:15.838
- Ah.
- (COUGHING)

00:54:15.839 --> 00:54:19.581
If you must cough on
someone, find a servant.

00:54:20.093 --> 00:54:22.011
Was that a bit harsh?

00:54:22.012 --> 00:54:23.245
Just a little.

00:54:23.912 --> 00:54:26.599
Are you all right, sir?

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.184
Your pardon, Madame.

00:54:28.185 --> 00:54:30.018
It's chronic, I'm afraid.

00:54:30.771 --> 00:54:33.905
Some Althea officinalis should
help soothe your throat.

00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:39.035
Didn't I see you talking
to Mary Hawkins earlier?

00:54:39.036 --> 00:54:40.529
You know her?

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.409
Enchanting girl.

00:54:43.116 --> 00:54:44.200
Yes, she is.

00:54:44.201 --> 00:54:45.952
Where are my manners?

00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:48.537
Mrs. Claire Fraser,

00:54:48.538 --> 00:54:50.790
may I introduce my new secretary,

00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:52.346
Alexander Randall.

00:54:52.926 --> 00:54:56.012
Yes, the name is not a coincidence.

00:54:56.013 --> 00:54:57.596
Alex is the younger brother

00:54:57.597 --> 00:55:01.655
of Captain Jonathan Randall, Esquire.

00:55:01.656 --> 00:55:05.815
Mrs. Fraser and your brother
are very well acquainted.

00:55:05.816 --> 00:55:08.817
Well, I will have to tell
Jonathan that I have met you.

00:55:12.114 --> 00:55:14.342
Tell him?

00:55:14.343 --> 00:55:18.178
(SCOFFS) I-I don't understand.

00:55:24.541 --> 00:55:26.575
Your brother, he isn't...

00:55:26.576 --> 00:55:27.576
dead?

00:55:27.577 --> 00:55:29.962
I certainly hope not.

00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:32.048
I received a letter from
Scotland this morning

00:55:32.049 --> 00:55:34.416
that he posted only two weeks ago.

00:55:36.772 --> 00:55:38.722
Can I be of assistance?

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:44.559
I'm fine. Thank you.

00:55:51.184 --> 00:55:54.103
I suppose I...

00:55:54.104 --> 00:55:56.405
heard a false rumor of his demise.

00:55:56.406 --> 00:55:59.358
Jonathan did suffer wounds
in the line of duty.

00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:00.659
They were not insignificant,

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.695
but, luckily, my brother is blessed

00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:04.663
with a much stronger
constitution than my own.

00:56:04.664 --> 00:56:06.082
(COUGHS)

00:56:06.083 --> 00:56:08.167
(FIREWORKS EXPLODE, CROWD OOHING)

00:56:08.168 --> 00:56:11.203
Oh! (LAUGHS)

00:56:11.204 --> 00:56:13.455
How lovely.

00:56:16.676 --> 00:56:20.212
Must they be so thunderous?

00:56:20.213 --> 00:56:22.047
Go and fetch my carriage.

00:56:38.198 --> 00:56:40.398
(CHUCKLES)

00:56:43.153 --> 00:56:45.653
<i>I barely heard the fireworks.</i>

00:56:52.162 --> 00:56:53.996
<i>What would happen when Jamie found out</i>

00:56:53.997 --> 00:56:56.164
<i>that Black Jack Randall was alive?</i>

00:56:57.514 --> 00:57:00.252
<i>Would his need for vengeance
eclipse our resolve</i>

00:57:00.253 --> 00:57:01.886
<i>to prevent the uprising?</i>

00:57:04.371 --> 00:57:05.979
<i>Should I even tell him?</i>

00:57:07.153 --> 00:57:10.596
<i>Even if I tried to keep that
appalling news from him,</i>

00:57:10.597 --> 00:57:13.159
<i>in time, he'd be sure
to learn the truth.</i>

00:57:14.101 --> 00:57:15.600
<i>What then?</i>

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:23.667
