00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.932
Previously...

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:27.583
- Aah! Stop!
- Make me a better offer.

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:30.308
Let her go in safety,
and you can have me.

00:00:30.374 --> 00:00:32.374
I know how we can save young Jamie.

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:37.307
Easy, lad.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:38.530
Hyah!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.263
If I don't set that hand,
he'll be crippled for life.

00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:43.288
What happened in that room
between you and Randall?

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.522
He made love to me.

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:48.458
You did what was necessary to survive.
That's all.

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:49.506
It's time we made plans.

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.506
He'll have to flee the country.

00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:52.174
Murtagh's gone to find
the boat for France.

00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.174
Good-bye to you, Claire.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.041
God bless.

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:57.408
How do you know what's going
to happen in Scotland?

00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:59.175
Well, what can we do but play our part?

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:00.678
What if we could stop it from happening?

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:02.022
Change the future?

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:03.913
There's something else. I'm pregnant.

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:07.822
Ahh!

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:14.443
I wished I were dead.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.143
And if I'd kept my eyes shut,

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.623
I could have almost touched
the edges of oblivion.

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:27.099
But I'd made a promise
and had to keep it.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.951
Even if it meant living a
life I no longer wanted.

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:24.475
He was gone.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:29.632
They were all gone.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:36.133
The world I'd left only
moments ago was now dust.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:13.408
You all right, ma'am?

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:19.941
Are you all right?

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:23.842
Ma'am?

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:29.141
Do you speak English?

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.408
What year is it?

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:36.908
The year?

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.928
What year is this?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.100
Why, it's 1948.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.766
Who won?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.483
Who won the Battle of Culloden?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.100
Do you not feel well?

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:58.766
Perhaps I could take you...

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.533
Tell me!

00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:03.520
Tell me who won the Battle
of Culloden, tell me now!

00:04:03.588 --> 00:04:06.154
The British! Cumberland and the British!

00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.721
Would you let me go?

00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:42.128

_

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.242
Excuse me.

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.242
- Excuse me, nurse?
- Yes?

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:08.375
My name is Randall, Frank Randall.

00:06:08.442 --> 00:06:09.742
I received a call from a Dr. Edwards?

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.109
Yes, sir.

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:12.741
One moment please, Mr. Randall.

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:14.675
Thank you.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.308
He's here.

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:23.642
Ah, Mr. Randall.

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.242
I'm Dr. Edwards.

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:26.475
Where is she?

00:06:26.542 --> 00:06:28.375
Oh, she's resting comfortably.

00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:30.042
Some dehydration,

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:33.442
and superficial cuts and
bruises notwithstanding,

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.042
ah, she appears to be in good health.

00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:36.175
Right.

00:06:36.242 --> 00:06:38.708
Emotionally, she's, um...

00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:42.375
well, she's better now, I should think.

00:06:42.442 --> 00:06:44.375
We gave her a sedative last night,

00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:46.108
and today she's much calmer.

00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:18.175
Can you turn that bloody
thing off, please?

00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:33.242
So noisy here.

00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:46.808
Oh...

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:47.875
Claire?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.908
Frank.

00:08:00.575 --> 00:08:02.675
Hello.

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:06.875
I'm back.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:11.775
And I am so grateful.

00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:18.675
- Are you?
- Of course.

00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:19.775
With all my heart.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:27.342
I'm sorry... wh...

00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:31.808
No.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.509
It's not you.

00:08:37.575 --> 00:08:40.406
- Mrs. Randall?
- Hey!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.800
What are you doing? Get out of here!

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:42.966
Easy now, I'm just doing my job.

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:44.666
Now watch the camera!

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:53.533
Claire.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.133
I've spoken with Reverend
Wakefield, and he's prepared

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.566
some rooms for us while you convalesce.

00:09:01.821 --> 00:09:05.221
No one will bother us there.

00:09:05.287 --> 00:09:09.787
Do you know if Mrs. Graham
is still in his employ?

00:09:09.854 --> 00:09:11.454
Mrs. Graham?

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:17.321
Um, I didn't ask, but I would assume so.

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:20.653
I need to speak with her.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:51.187
I'm going to need some clothes.

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:15.954
Has she said anything?

00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:21.620
No, only pleasantries.

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:27.621
I've received an answer from
my friend, Professor Atkins.

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:30.853
Oh?

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:32.882
"Examined the clothing you sent,

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:34.682
"appears to be a marvelous example

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:37.982
"of authentic 18th century
Scottish woman's wardrobe.

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:39.949
"Incredibly valuable.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.081
Where did you find?"

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:46.049
Oh, that's a good question.

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:47.515
What are you gonna tell him?

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:53.849
What can I tell him?

00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:55.515
This is not the sort
of outfit she could've

00:10:55.582 --> 00:10:57.882
just walked into a shop
and purchased, is it?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.715
No.

00:11:00.849 --> 00:11:03.149
No, sir.

00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:05.581
It's puzzling, that.

00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:11.115
Oh, she's nearly exhausted my collection

00:11:11.182 --> 00:11:13.915
on Culloden and the Jacobite rebellion.

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:16.715
Why the sudden obsession
with Scottish history?

00:11:16.782 --> 00:11:19.715
I have no idea.

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:22.587
She never showed much interest
when she was with...

00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:27.549
before.

00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:31.048
So many questions. She's
been back nearly a week.

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:32.781
Don't you think it's time
she gave you some answers?

00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:34.649
I believe she will, when she's ready.

00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:42.015
Well, my sermon is not
going to write itself.

00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:45.948
You know, you're not the
only one with questions.

00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:47.581
Hmm?

00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:55.048
Devil take the press.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.715
Hm. That's not likely.

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:00.648
Even the devil has standards.

00:12:20.024 --> 00:12:21.290
There has to be a fuller account

00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:22.890
of the Highlander losses somewhere.

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:26.524
Well, I must say, the Reverend has
the finest collection in Scotland.

00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.291
Even the curator of Old
Leanach Cottage himself

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:32.090
has been known to borrow
books from our collection.

00:12:35.724 --> 00:12:37.224
Must they do that every day?

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:40.091
People are saying there might
be a war with Russia soon.

00:12:40.157 --> 00:12:41.957
Stalin's trying to block
access to West Berlin...

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:44.557
There's always another fucking war!

00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:49.657
I'm so sorry.

00:12:57.991 --> 00:13:00.157
You know, he didn't even
know what that word meant.

00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:08.090
I actually called him a
fucking sadist once,

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:11.023
and he'd no idea what
I was talking about.

00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:16.501
We had a good laugh about it afterwards.

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:21.066
You know, whenever you talk about him,

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:26.624
you nearly always mention
his fine sense of humor.

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.857
Do I?

00:13:30.924 --> 00:13:32.657
Aye.

00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:36.274
And his smile, and his hair.

00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:39.323
It really is the most...

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.657
Was.

00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:55.590
It really was the most
extraordinary mop of red

00:13:55.657 --> 00:13:57.657
you'd ever seen.

00:13:59.657 --> 00:14:01.823
- It's...
- You don't have to say it.

00:14:04.124 --> 00:14:07.757
I know, he's dead.

00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:11.290
Dead, and buried, and...
moldering in the ground

00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:14.057
for the past two centuries.

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.657
I just want to know...

00:14:20.724 --> 00:14:24.657
I just need to know if he really did

00:14:24.724 --> 00:14:28.290
die on that battlefield.

00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:30.657
He told you he would stand and die

00:14:30.724 --> 00:14:33.290
with his men on that bloody moor.

00:14:33.357 --> 00:14:36.723
Do you have any reason
to doubt his word?

00:14:38.057 --> 00:14:39.857
No.

00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:43.424
You have had

00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:46.991
an extraordinary adventure, Claire.

00:14:47.057 --> 00:14:48.690
Extraordinary.

00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:53.423
One that few people could even imagine.

00:14:53.491 --> 00:14:55.157
Treasure it.

00:14:55.224 --> 00:14:57.224
Keep it safe and secure,

00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.257
tucked away in some special
place in your heart,

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:03.742
but...

00:15:05.257 --> 00:15:09.190
don't spend the rest of
your days chasing a ghost.

00:15:09.257 --> 00:15:11.190
Not when there's a man,

00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:15.057
a real flesh and blood living man,

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:19.056
who loves you still with all his heart.

00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:10.664
Frank?

00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:19.532
Claire.

00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:26.565
Would you care to come in?

00:16:26.632 --> 00:16:30.298
I thought we could talk.

00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:59.464
This reminds me of that night at Mrs.
Baird's.

00:16:59.532 --> 00:17:02.465
Sitting by the fire,

00:17:02.598 --> 00:17:06.431
drinking good Scottish whiskey.

00:17:06.498 --> 00:17:08.598
More candles, as I recall.

00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.598
The power had gone out.

00:17:15.632 --> 00:17:17.698
You remember.

00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:19.065
Of course.

00:17:19.132 --> 00:17:21.365
It was our last night together.

00:17:24.132 --> 00:17:27.665
Yes.

00:17:27.732 --> 00:17:30.798
Frank, I want to tell you
what happened to me after...

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.865
You... you don't have to.

00:17:32.932 --> 00:17:35.498
I, I want you to know that.

00:17:35.565 --> 00:17:39.698
Whatever happened, wherever you've been.

00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:42.501
What really matters to me
is, is that you're back.

00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:46.859
I don't really care about anything else.

00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:49.092
So let me tell it at my own pace.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.393
Save any questions you
have until the end.

00:18:06.705 --> 00:18:11.371
Remember I went back to
Craigh na Dun that day

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.730
to look for a flower that
I'd seen near the stones.

00:18:52.472 --> 00:18:55.138
I know how it must sound,

00:18:55.206 --> 00:18:57.306
that I've gone mad.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.057
It's quite the leap of faith.

00:19:24.957 --> 00:19:29.523
But...

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.590
It is one that I am
prepared to make as well.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.456
Don't patronize me, Frank.

00:19:35.523 --> 00:19:37.356
It's insane, I know that.

00:19:37.423 --> 00:19:40.589
It sounds like a... a fantasy
made of magic and fairy dust.

00:19:40.657 --> 00:19:42.723
Are you trying to argue
me out of believing you?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.156
I'm trying to get you to admit
that even as you stand there

00:19:47.223 --> 00:19:49.441
trying to be supportive
and understanding,

00:19:49.496 --> 00:19:51.762
that rational, academic brain of yours

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.096
is screaming out that your ex-wife

00:19:54.163 --> 00:19:55.396
has either lost her mind

00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:58.096
or has fabricated some wild tale to...

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:01.096
- to drive you away!
- "Ex-wife?"

00:20:01.397 --> 00:20:03.235
I married another man.

00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:06.798
And yet you are still
wearing our wedding ring.

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:16.798
Claire, I admit it is hard to
reconcile what you are saying

00:20:16.865 --> 00:20:20.831
with anything resembling
logic, or even natural law.

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:24.765
But, Claire, I think we are beyond that.

00:20:24.832 --> 00:20:28.832
Truly, all that matters
is that you're back.

00:20:28.899 --> 00:20:30.225
You're back.

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:35.751
Frank, I was with another man

00:20:35.828 --> 00:20:37.794
for two years.

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:40.527
And I loved him, deeply, as his wife.

00:20:40.594 --> 00:20:41.660
A point you have made several times,

00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:43.294
I do understand, Claire.

00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:45.161
But I don't think you
understand my perspective,

00:20:45.228 --> 00:20:46.428
what it was actually like

00:20:46.494 --> 00:20:49.147
to have you just torn away like that.

00:20:50.913 --> 00:20:52.179
I'm sorry, that must...

00:20:52.247 --> 00:20:54.180
No, please.

00:20:54.247 --> 00:20:55.936
You have said a great deal.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.653
I only need a few minutes.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.553
When you disappeared,

00:21:01.606 --> 00:21:04.639
everyone wanted me to
believe that you had left

00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:07.706
of your own volition with another man.

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:11.539
And for a time I wanted to
believe that, too, believe me.

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:14.206
So that I could fill...

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:17.539
the utter void that I felt

00:21:17.606 --> 00:21:19.906
with rage...

00:21:19.973 --> 00:21:22.206
with betrayal...

00:21:22.273 --> 00:21:23.573
with hatred...

00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:31.872
But I... I couldn't.

00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:38.206
Because deep down I knew...

00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:40.739
I knew that whatever had happened,

00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:42.839
you did not choose to leave me,

00:21:42.906 --> 00:21:44.472
that something had taken you from me,

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:46.272
and everything that you
have told me tonight

00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:49.339
confirms at least that.

00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:52.272
Now as for this...

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:54.905
this other man...

00:21:54.973 --> 00:21:58.773
Jamie.

00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:00.272
I will not say

00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:03.906
that I understand your feelings for him.

00:22:03.973 --> 00:22:06.273
How could I possibly?

00:22:11.223 --> 00:22:12.789
But I can accept them.

00:22:12.856 --> 00:22:16.389
I can accept that you...

00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:18.789
that you did feel that way,

00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:20.856
that you had this...

00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:23.123
this experience with this man,

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.456
and that leaving him broke your heart.

00:22:29.456 --> 00:22:32.089
I can accept it.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.456
I don't think you understand...

00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:42.023
Claire, I once told you

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.756
there was nothing you could say or do

00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:46.023
to change how I felt about you.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.756
I meant it then, and I mean it now.

00:22:49.823 --> 00:22:52.556
I love you, Claire.

00:22:52.623 --> 00:22:54.289
Unconditionally, no matter what.

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:58.230
And here, now, and in this time.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.223
Darling, I... Jesus.

00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:06.289
I'm, I am your husband,
and you're my wife.

00:23:06.356 --> 00:23:08.822
We can still have a life together.

00:23:08.882 --> 00:23:13.482
Please, Claire.

00:23:13.556 --> 00:23:15.051
I'm pregnant.

00:23:18.423 --> 00:23:22.223
Pregnant, what?

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.290
Claire, that's wonderful.

00:23:24.356 --> 00:23:26.522
How is that... how is that...

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.823
No.

00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.356
No...

00:23:38.423 --> 00:23:41.723
It's Jamie's.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.590
No.

00:23:43.656 --> 00:23:46.656
I'm carrying another man's child, Frank.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.723
You need to think about that,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.856
and what that means.

00:23:54.923 --> 00:23:56.323
For all of us.

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:38.899
Good morning, Mr. Randall.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.256
You're up early.

00:24:41.323 --> 00:24:42.923
Breakfast will be in about...

00:25:47.957 --> 00:25:52.557
Forgive me, I apologize for the...
for all the damage.

00:25:52.623 --> 00:25:53.923
I will, of course, make the full...

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.323
No, no, no, think nothing of it.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.924
No, it was a... a lot of old junk

00:25:57.949 --> 00:26:01.849
I should've put in the
dust bin years ago.

00:26:01.982 --> 00:26:06.282
No, we need to focus
on what's important.

00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:10.149
You say that... that Claire is...

00:26:10.216 --> 00:26:13.849
is with child.

00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:17.149
This, uh, other man, are
you certain he's dead?

00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:23.000
Yes.

00:26:23.068 --> 00:26:27.401
Her, um, her grief on that
account seemed genuine.

00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:30.134
Do you want to raise a child?

00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:33.001
Have, have you thought seriously
about having children?

00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:37.601
Claire and I had tried to start a family

00:26:37.668 --> 00:26:39.768
before she disappeared,

00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:43.000
but, uh, without success.

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:46.501
I became concerned that

00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:49.501
perhaps I was incapable.

00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:50.934
Medically.

00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:53.967
And I visited a doctor
in Oxford last year,

00:26:54.034 --> 00:26:57.767
and his examination
confirmed that suspicion.

00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:00.901
I'm sterile.

00:27:02.328 --> 00:27:05.861
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

00:27:07.462 --> 00:27:10.362
Well, first I, uh, I
reasoned with myself

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:15.028
that with my wife gone,

00:27:15.095 --> 00:27:18.741
the question of my fertility was,

00:27:18.945 --> 00:27:22.045
well, an academic one at best,

00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:25.045
so I pushed the subject aside,

00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:27.112
concentrated on my work.

00:27:31.478 --> 00:27:33.811
When Claire told me

00:27:33.878 --> 00:27:36.611
that she was pregnant,

00:27:36.678 --> 00:27:39.044
I was...

00:27:39.112 --> 00:27:42.745
I just...

00:27:42.812 --> 00:27:45.878
my first feeling was...

00:27:45.945 --> 00:27:48.011
was joy.

00:27:48.078 --> 00:27:51.244
This flash of...

00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:54.845
of just happiness.

00:27:54.912 --> 00:27:58.245
It was almost hallucinatory

00:27:58.312 --> 00:28:00.212
in its intensity... I just...

00:28:04.312 --> 00:28:08.878
Because...

00:28:08.945 --> 00:28:11.778
somehow, suddenly, in that moment, I...

00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:22.078
I thought she meant

00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:24.778
wewere having a child.

00:28:31.112 --> 00:28:32.945
God.

00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:35.745
Then I realized, of course...

00:28:38.678 --> 00:28:40.511
Couldn't be mine.

00:28:52.145 --> 00:28:53.311
Had to be his.

00:28:53.378 --> 00:28:54.978
Listen to me now.

00:28:55.045 --> 00:28:57.611
Other men have faced this...

00:28:57.678 --> 00:28:58.778
have faced this situation.

00:28:58.845 --> 00:29:00.311
I, I doubt that very much.

00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:03.211
When Mary told Joseph
that she was with child,

00:29:03.278 --> 00:29:05.878
and he couldn't be the father, he...
he... he...

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.111
he too was confronted
with a crisis of...

00:29:08.178 --> 00:29:10.978
I am not Joseph! She is not Mary.

00:29:11.045 --> 00:29:12.878
And I am fairly certain that the father

00:29:12.945 --> 00:29:14.111
is not God Almighty.

00:29:14.178 --> 00:29:16.678
He was a man, a man who fucked my wife.

00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:19.900
Yes, Roger?

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:22.867
Please, may I go outside to play?

00:29:22.934 --> 00:29:24.467
Of course, you may.

00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:25.934
You keep your breeks out of the dirt,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.133
or Mrs. Graham will be on the warpath.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.766
Yes, father.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.100
Forgive me.

00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:46.933
No, no, no, he's fine. He's fine.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.533
I, I doubt he heard very much.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.600
I don't think I've ever
heard him call you father.

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:56.767
He's... he's taking to
doing it more of late.

00:29:56.834 --> 00:30:01.034
Children accept the world
as it is presented to them.

00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:04.309
He knows I'm not his father,
but that's how he sees me,

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:08.409
and... well, I've decided
to stop correcting him.

00:30:08.476 --> 00:30:10.176
Please...

00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:12.609
you're going to connect your
nephew to my situation.

00:30:12.676 --> 00:30:15.909
The words "God's plan"

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:18.874
are about to escape your lips, I...

00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:21.378
Well, at the risk of fulfilling

00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:24.778
your worst expectations,
I will say this.

00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:27.745
A child without a father,

00:30:27.812 --> 00:30:31.812
and, and a man without a child

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:34.112
have been given this chance
to find one another.

00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:37.912
And yes, I would call that
part of God's eternal plan.

00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:40.879
What you choose to call it, Frank,

00:30:40.945 --> 00:30:42.745
well, that's up to you.

00:30:48.145 --> 00:30:49.945
Just like that?

00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:52.312
We just pick up where we left off?

00:30:57.012 --> 00:30:58.778
Are you sure about this, Frank?

00:30:58.845 --> 00:31:00.511
Perhaps you should take
some time to think about...

00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:02.378
I've had too much time to think.

00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:04.445
Two years to contemplate the prospect

00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:06.512
of a solitary existence.

00:31:06.579 --> 00:31:08.512
I want us to be together.

00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:10.512
Man and wife.

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:12.379
And child.

00:31:12.445 --> 00:31:14.545
We start over.

00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:20.718
I have been offered a post at Harvard.

00:31:20.785 --> 00:31:22.285
I was going to turn it down.

00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:24.951
Now I have a mind to take it.

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:27.418
To Boston.

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:30.185
Yes, the story of the...

00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:33.651
"the lady taken by the fairies,"

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.043
as long as you're here, the
British press will flog it...

00:31:36.118 --> 00:31:38.918
Please, Frank,

00:31:38.985 --> 00:31:40.785
don't ever use the word "flog"

00:31:40.851 --> 00:31:43.051
in my presence again,
is that understood?

00:31:48.718 --> 00:31:50.251
Very well.

00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:00.017
I also have conditions.

00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:09.824
We will raise this child as our own.
Ours.

00:32:09.892 --> 00:32:13.025
Yours and mine.

00:32:13.092 --> 00:32:14.258
Raised in a lie.

00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:16.991
No, with a father.

00:32:17.058 --> 00:32:18.758
A living, breathing man.

00:32:18.825 --> 00:32:22.191
Not the echo of a memory
that they can never catch.

00:32:24.892 --> 00:32:26.192
Not a ghost.

00:32:26.258 --> 00:32:28.858
Precisely.

00:32:32.825 --> 00:32:34.891
You have other conditions?

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:41.691
Only one.

00:32:43.892 --> 00:32:46.392
While I draw breath on this earth,

00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:49.258
I cannot share you with another man.

00:32:49.325 --> 00:32:51.758
No more research.

00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:54.725
No more combing through the
libraries of the world,

00:32:54.792 --> 00:32:57.758
hoping to find some reference to him

00:32:57.825 --> 00:33:00.391
or to the life you once led.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.633
You must let him go.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.466
I know.

00:33:12.906 --> 00:33:16.906
I promised him I would.

00:33:16.973 --> 00:33:20.173
He made me promise

00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:22.305
that I would let him go.

00:33:29.606 --> 00:33:31.306
So I will.

00:33:37.073 --> 00:33:39.539
I accept your conditions.

00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:12.144
You have made me very happy,

00:34:12.473 --> 00:34:14.106
and I hope, in time,

00:34:14.173 --> 00:34:18.839
that I will make you happy, too.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.006
Time to leave the past behind.

00:34:59.473 --> 00:35:02.173
It's all right.

00:35:03.673 --> 00:35:05.273
When you're ready.

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.899
Thank you.

00:37:59.398 --> 00:38:01.298
One more step.

00:38:22.997 --> 00:38:25.330
- To new beginnings.
- Aye.

00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:26.796
I thought you were going
to knock people over,

00:38:26.863 --> 00:38:28.396
trying to get off that gangway.

00:38:28.463 --> 00:38:29.829
I couldn't take another moment on that

00:38:29.896 --> 00:38:32.396
rolling, creaking, leaking tub.

00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:35.796
So I guess a trip to Boston
is out of the question?

00:38:35.863 --> 00:38:37.796
Not unless ye want to bury me at sea.

00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:40.329
Well, there were times

00:38:40.396 --> 00:38:42.162
I thought it would be the
merciful thing to do.

00:38:45.496 --> 00:38:46.662
France.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.505
Reeks of frogs,

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.936
just as I remember it.

00:38:53.904 --> 00:38:56.676
I think you'll find
what you smell is fish,

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.367
and I doubt there's a
seaport in all the world

00:38:58.434 --> 00:39:00.100
that smells any different.

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:03.233
I'll arrange for some
rooms for us somewhere.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.500
Somewhere away from all this stink.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.266
Sure.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.300
Hey, hey, careful there!

00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:18.699
That's not a sack of
grain yer tossing about!

00:40:12.533 --> 00:40:14.233
A bed...

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.666
that doesna move.

00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:24.666
Luxury.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.333
What is it?

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.866
Sometimes I...

00:40:39.933 --> 00:40:41.833
feel his touch.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.733
Like he's here.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.300
I'm here, I'm right here,

00:40:47.366 --> 00:40:49.332
and I'm not going away.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.500
You're a hard one to get
rid of, that's for sure.

00:40:54.566 --> 00:40:57.599
I'm stubborn, just like my husband.

00:40:57.666 --> 00:41:01.232
Hmm.

00:41:01.366 --> 00:41:05.299
Now... let's talk about the future,

00:41:05.366 --> 00:41:07.999
and how we're going to change it.

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:10.566
You're talking about

00:41:10.633 --> 00:41:13.566
stopping the Jacobite rebellion?

00:41:13.633 --> 00:41:15.933
Well, that is what we
agreed to, isn't it?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.566
I thought we agreed to think about it?

00:41:19.633 --> 00:41:23.933
If there's going to be a
war against the British,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.933
should we not be trying
to find a way to win it

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.600
instead of stopping it?

00:41:27.666 --> 00:41:30.566
Well, I don't know enough details

00:41:30.633 --> 00:41:32.233
to tell you how to do that.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.433
Well...

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.366
what... what do you know, exactly?

00:41:42.866 --> 00:41:45.499
Just the general outlines of history.

00:41:45.566 --> 00:41:49.232
I know that Bonnie Prince
Charlie comes to Scotland

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.666
and raises a Jacobite army.

00:41:51.733 --> 00:41:53.399
At first they have several victories...

00:41:53.466 --> 00:41:55.166
Well, that's a start, is it not?

00:41:55.233 --> 00:41:57.766
Can we not build on that,
help them to keep winning?

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.500
I don't know the tactics.

00:42:01.943 --> 00:42:03.208
I don't know the strategy.

00:42:03.255 --> 00:42:05.288
I don't know where the armies were,

00:42:05.355 --> 00:42:07.488
why they won, or how they lost.

00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:11.019
All I know is that
eventually both sides end up

00:42:11.044 --> 00:42:15.777
on Culloden Moor in April 1746,

00:42:15.844 --> 00:42:18.810
and the Jacobites are wiped out.

00:42:18.878 --> 00:42:21.778
And after that, the British
destroy the Highland culture

00:42:21.844 --> 00:42:24.910
in retribution.

00:42:24.978 --> 00:42:27.144
That is the sum total of
my knowledge of the war.

00:42:29.178 --> 00:42:31.811
That's not a lot to go on, Sassenach.

00:42:31.878 --> 00:42:34.844
But it starts now.

00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:37.044
Here, with Charles in France.

00:42:37.111 --> 00:42:39.544
I mean, we have to stop it here,

00:42:39.611 --> 00:42:42.477
before the prince sails for Scotland.

00:42:42.544 --> 00:42:45.677
We can infiltrate the Jacobite movement.

00:42:45.744 --> 00:42:47.744
Get close to the key players.

00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:50.177
Discover where they get
their money and their arms,

00:42:50.244 --> 00:42:52.210
and find a way to disrupt their plans.

00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:58.677
You certainly have high
opinion of what a...

00:42:58.744 --> 00:43:00.844
crippled Highlander and a
pregnant English woman

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:04.478
can accomplish.

00:43:04.544 --> 00:43:06.710
Since when were you not
up for a challenge?

00:43:08.978 --> 00:43:12.844
Your cousin Jared lives in
Paris, he's a Jacobite.

00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:16.677
He can vouch for us,
make some introductions.

00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:25.044
What are you thinking?

00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:29.910
I'm thinking it's not
a very honorable path

00:43:29.978 --> 00:43:33.044
you're laying out for us.

00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:35.044
It's not just lying to my cousin.

00:43:37.678 --> 00:43:39.111
We'd be lying to everyone.

00:43:39.178 --> 00:43:41.878
But you have to remember
what's at stake.

00:43:41.944 --> 00:43:44.610
We're talking about tens
of thousands of lives,

00:43:44.678 --> 00:43:47.811
and the future of Scotland itself.

00:43:47.878 --> 00:43:50.978
Surely that's worth the price?

00:43:51.044 --> 00:43:53.844
Even if that price is our souls?

00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:56.544
That won't happen.

00:43:56.611 --> 00:43:59.277
We won't let that happen.

00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:04.344
We have to trust in this.

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:11.896
In this I do.

00:44:15.666 --> 00:44:18.032
And in this I will.

00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:27.708
I'll, uh, I'll write a letter to Jared

00:44:27.775 --> 00:44:29.408
asking him for his help.

00:44:46.408 --> 00:44:47.774
What?

00:44:49.675 --> 00:44:52.208
What the hell are we
going to tell Murtagh?

00:44:59.808 --> 00:45:01.574
So that's all you'll tell me, hmm?

00:45:02.416 --> 00:45:03.337
Nothing more?

00:45:03.564 --> 00:45:05.764
- We can't, I'm sorry.
- You must trust us.

00:45:05.831 --> 00:45:07.797
I trust ye with my life,

00:45:07.864 --> 00:45:10.897
ye ken that well.

00:45:10.964 --> 00:45:12.964
But it seems to me ye
don't trust me to know

00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:14.931
the true reason behind this...

00:45:14.997 --> 00:45:18.997
this cloth of lies we're
about to wrap ourselves in,

00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:22.564
like a plaid woven out
of guile and deception.

00:45:22.631 --> 00:45:25.797
We've told you the reason,
to stop the Jacobite rising.

00:45:25.864 --> 00:45:27.764
That is the purpose of the lie.

00:45:27.831 --> 00:45:29.131
It's not the reason.

00:45:29.197 --> 00:45:30.630
The rising is doomed to failure.

00:45:30.697 --> 00:45:31.783
it must not happen.

00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:33.915
Again, not the reason.

00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:36.255
The true reason behind yer certainty

00:45:36.322 --> 00:45:39.388
remains carefully hid.

00:45:39.932 --> 00:45:41.698
And you're hiding it from me.

00:45:47.165 --> 00:45:50.098
You're right.

00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:52.898
We are keeping it hidden.

00:45:52.965 --> 00:45:54.598
But believe me, if we could...

00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:56.831
One day...

00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:01.198
I will tell you the reason.

00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:05.931
I vow to you.

00:46:05.998 --> 00:46:08.264
I'll tell you everything
that has happened

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.932
and why.

00:46:10.998 --> 00:46:14.331
At the proper time.

00:46:19.098 --> 00:46:22.931
Aye.

00:46:22.998 --> 00:46:25.564
That'll do.

00:46:30.365 --> 00:46:33.031
And when will be "the proper time?"

00:46:33.098 --> 00:46:34.898
You tell me, Sassenach.

00:46:34.965 --> 00:46:38.065
You're the one from the future.

00:46:45.998 --> 00:46:49.298
I admire your patriotism, to be sure.

00:46:49.365 --> 00:46:52.631
But I am curious as to your
sudden change of heart.

00:46:52.698 --> 00:46:55.664
Well, Jared, my heart has ever been

00:46:55.732 --> 00:46:58.165
full of love for my country.

00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:00.665
Aye.

00:47:00.798 --> 00:47:03.164
But you miss my meaning.

00:47:08.432 --> 00:47:10.998
We've known each other a long time.

00:47:11.065 --> 00:47:12.698
You've lived in my house.

00:47:12.765 --> 00:47:15.165
You've dined at my table.

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.332
You've lifted more than one
glass with me at establishments

00:47:17.398 --> 00:47:20.864
too disreputable to mention
in front of your fair bride.

00:47:20.932 --> 00:47:24.165
Dinna fash on her account.
She's a sturdy woman.

00:47:24.232 --> 00:47:25.532
"Sturdy."

00:47:25.598 --> 00:47:27.364
Why, Jamie, you do flatter me so.

00:47:27.432 --> 00:47:30.232
Nevertheless, in all that time,

00:47:30.298 --> 00:47:32.098
I never heard you once voice

00:47:32.165 --> 00:47:34.365
even the slightest interest in politics.

00:47:37.165 --> 00:47:38.965
In France, to be known as a Jacobite

00:47:39.032 --> 00:47:41.965
is a badge of honor,
supporters of the true faith

00:47:42.032 --> 00:47:43.865
against the heretic on the throne.

00:47:43.932 --> 00:47:46.732
But we have enemies, to be sure.

00:47:46.798 --> 00:47:49.364
Enemies that would delight
in watching us dance a jig

00:47:49.432 --> 00:47:50.865
on the gallows back in England.

00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:53.832
So while the cause has many friends,

00:47:53.898 --> 00:47:56.198
only a few are called brother,

00:47:56.265 --> 00:47:59.231
and they are the ones with
the fire of righteousness

00:47:59.298 --> 00:48:01.064
burning in their hearts.

00:48:03.522 --> 00:48:08.455
Tell me now, what is the
fire that burns within you?

00:48:42.722 --> 00:48:46.455
Show him.

00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:53.689
Courtesy of the British army.

00:48:57.656 --> 00:48:59.022
Also a crippled hand

00:48:59.089 --> 00:49:01.672
and several scars across
his mangled body.

00:49:03.156 --> 00:49:06.056
Now, I ask you plainly,

00:49:06.122 --> 00:49:08.988
does any man need further reason

00:49:09.056 --> 00:49:11.889
to rise up against a king

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.496
that would allow such horrors

00:49:13.563 --> 00:49:16.729
to be carried out in his name?

00:49:16.796 --> 00:49:19.862
No.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:24.230
The cause can only be
strengthened by your sword.

00:49:24.296 --> 00:49:27.729
I'm sorry I doubted you, brother.

00:49:27.796 --> 00:49:30.129
Will you help us then?

00:49:30.196 --> 00:49:33.962
In what way?

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.130
What is it exactly that
you would wish me to do?

00:49:38.296 --> 00:49:41.829
I want to meet the Jacobite
leaders face to face.

00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:44.729
I want to hear their plans,

00:49:44.796 --> 00:49:47.262
how they mean to carry them out.

00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:55.729
Why should they meet with you?

00:49:55.796 --> 00:49:57.262
A wanted man in his own country

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.163
now come to France with
a price on his head

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:01.496
and not much more than
the clothes on his back?

00:50:01.563 --> 00:50:04.996
I should think the Stuarts
would value the support

00:50:05.063 --> 00:50:08.063
of Laird Broch Tuarach

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.130
and the Fraser clan,

00:50:11.196 --> 00:50:12.496
should they plan on
returning to Scotland

00:50:12.563 --> 00:50:15.229
in the near future.

00:50:15.296 --> 00:50:16.862
Perhaps.

00:50:19.396 --> 00:50:22.362
I shall give it some thought.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.996
But in the meantime,

00:50:25.063 --> 00:50:28.263
I believe we can be of
help to one another.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.330
I've been delaying a
trip to the West Indies

00:50:30.396 --> 00:50:33.429
until I could find someone
competent and trustworthy enough

00:50:33.496 --> 00:50:35.496
to run the wine business in my absence.

00:50:35.563 --> 00:50:40.096
You have a fine head for
figures, as I recall?

00:50:40.163 --> 00:50:41.729
Aye.

00:50:41.796 --> 00:50:43.729
But I know nothing of the wine business,

00:50:43.796 --> 00:50:45.129
beyond drinking, of course.

00:50:45.196 --> 00:50:48.062
I've seen you drink. You will do fine.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:51.430
And in return, I will give you
the run of my house in Paris,

00:50:51.496 --> 00:50:53.829
and while I'm gone, a
share of the profits.

00:50:53.896 --> 00:50:55.129
Say, twenty-five percent.

00:50:55.196 --> 00:50:58.162
Thirty-five percent.

00:51:01.654 --> 00:51:03.187
And your help.

00:51:03.254 --> 00:51:07.887
Oh, you will do just fine.

00:51:07.953 --> 00:51:09.919
Done.

00:51:15.653 --> 00:51:17.919
While Jamie inspected
the shipment of port,

00:51:17.986 --> 00:51:20.586
I went for a walk.

00:51:20.653 --> 00:51:22.219
I was beginning to be susceptible

00:51:22.286 --> 00:51:24.586
to bouts of morning sickness,

00:51:24.653 --> 00:51:27.586
and while the air along the
docks wasn't exactly fresh,

00:51:27.653 --> 00:51:30.086
it was better than the close confines

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.386
of our temporary lodgings.

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:04.319
Claire!

00:52:09.453 --> 00:52:11.253
Claire!

00:52:29.386 --> 00:52:31.252
The captain tried to stop me

00:52:31.319 --> 00:52:34.230
from seeing the sick crewman
because he knew the truth.

00:52:34.394 --> 00:52:37.394
Claire!

00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:38.761
Claire.

00:52:38.828 --> 00:52:39.828
No, stay back.

00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:41.191
Stay back, it's all right.

00:52:41.215 --> 00:52:43.380
If this is what I think
it is, I can't get it.

00:52:45.472 --> 00:52:47.305
Pus-filled
blisters, and high fever.

00:52:47.372 --> 00:52:49.386
The diagnosis was obvious.

00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:50.910
_

00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:52.972
_

00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:57.357
This will be trouble.

00:53:02.239 --> 00:53:05.705
Le Comte St. Germain.

00:53:11.488 --> 00:53:13.097
_

00:53:15.277 --> 00:53:16.566
_

00:53:16.746 --> 00:53:18.511
_

00:53:18.535 --> 00:53:21.566
_

00:53:36.098 --> 00:53:37.465
_

00:53:50.973 --> 00:53:52.746
_

00:53:55.277 --> 00:53:56.941
_

00:53:56.966 --> 00:53:58.105
_

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:01.643
_

00:54:03.034 --> 00:54:05.659
_

00:54:05.684 --> 00:54:08.213
_

00:54:08.238 --> 00:54:10.732
_

00:54:10.757 --> 00:54:12.740
- _
- _

00:54:14.535 --> 00:54:16.301
These men must be quarantined.

00:54:16.326 --> 00:54:18.059
We need to contact the local
medical authorities...

00:54:18.126 --> 00:54:19.226
No, this is a matter best left

00:54:19.292 --> 00:54:20.932
to the port authorities, Sassenach.

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:22.357
Jamie, I can't just...

00:54:22.424 --> 00:54:25.090
Claire, trust me.

00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:26.890
Claire!

00:54:28.216 --> 00:54:30.497
_

00:54:30.523 --> 00:54:32.670
_

00:54:32.695 --> 00:54:33.966
_

00:54:34.154 --> 00:54:36.474
_

00:54:37.216 --> 00:54:38.599
_

00:54:38.857 --> 00:54:40.295
_

00:54:40.646 --> 00:54:43.771
_

00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:50.627
Claire, we have to go.

00:54:50.694 --> 00:54:53.260
There's nothing more you can do here.

00:55:04.513 --> 00:55:05.631
_

00:55:09.466 --> 00:55:10.896
_

00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:13.959
_

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.419
_

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.756
_

00:55:19.781 --> 00:55:22.013
_

00:55:23.638 --> 00:55:26.927
_

00:55:27.763 --> 00:55:29.326
_

00:55:30.373 --> 00:55:32.607
_

00:55:32.632 --> 00:55:34.482
_

00:55:34.861 --> 00:55:36.060
Monsieur...

00:55:36.085 --> 00:55:39.123
_

00:55:39.148 --> 00:55:41.248
_

00:55:41.732 --> 00:55:43.427
_

00:55:44.269 --> 00:55:45.869
Senior Broch Tuarach...

00:55:46.334 --> 00:55:47.529
_

00:55:47.818 --> 00:55:51.552
_

00:55:51.904 --> 00:55:53.670
_

00:55:53.912 --> 00:55:56.045
_

00:55:56.552 --> 00:55:57.911
_

00:56:00.369 --> 00:56:04.269
I have done nothing more
than state the truth.

00:56:04.451 --> 00:56:07.256
_

00:56:07.857 --> 00:56:11.334
_

00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:13.467
_

00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:17.146
_

00:56:21.654 --> 00:56:23.154
_

00:56:24.552 --> 00:56:26.279
_

00:56:56.669 --> 00:56:57.969
Make no mistake.

00:56:58.036 --> 00:57:01.902
The Comte will not forget what happened.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.350
You've made an enemy here today.

00:57:14.583 --> 00:57:16.549
Another country, another enemy.

00:57:16.617 --> 00:57:19.017
Life with you is certainly
never dull, Sassenach.

00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:20.616
I shall endeavor to be

00:57:20.683 --> 00:57:23.516
more dull, if that
would suit you better.

00:57:23.583 --> 00:57:27.349
I wouldn't change you to save the world.

00:58:06.972 --> 00:58:10.105
