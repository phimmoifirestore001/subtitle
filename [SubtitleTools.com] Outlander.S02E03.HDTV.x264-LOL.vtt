00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.090
Previously...

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.821
Black Jack Randall is dead.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.259
You've made an enemy here today.

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.596
Thank you. I could use a friend.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.223
Jenny found this.

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:22.517
- Sawney.
- Mary Hawkins, Madame.

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.311
I'm sure I've heard that name before.

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.521
Thought we came here to
prevent a rebellion,

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:28.648
and the head of the rebellion
is Charles Stuart.

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:32.527
God demands that a Catholic
king sit on the English throne.

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:34.571
He'll get us all
killed if we don't stop him.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:36.614
All we have to do is see to it
that his war chest remains empty.

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:39.743
That was the Minister of Finance!

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.329
Perhaps there is some way
I can be of service.

00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:45.788
Alex is the younger brother
of Captain Jonathan Randall.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.625
I will have to tell
Jonathan that I've met you.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.626
- Your brother, he isn't dead?
- I certainly hope not.

00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:49.580
We're leaving in a few minutes.

00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.352
Oh.

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.587
I didn't mean to wake you, Sassenach.

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:13.506
Another long night at Maison Elise?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.843
Aye. I fear Prince Charles
has run out of patience

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:18.594
with your husband.

00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:21.389
Last night he demanded that I
finally arrange that meeting

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:23.391
he's been wanting with
Minister Duverney.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:25.560
And he wants it subito.

00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:26.602
That's Italian for "right away."

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:28.269
I know what that means.

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:30.315
Well, I suppose it had to
happen sooner or later.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.735
I'm impressed you managed
to delay it all this time.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.278
Do you think Duverney will consent

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:36.944
to a meeting with The Prince?

00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:42.450
I have no idea,

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:44.746
but I really have no time for that now.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.622
I must away.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:49.959
A government inspector's coming
to examine Jared's warehouse,

00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:52.545
and then it's a mad
gallop to Versailles,

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.962
chess and a blether with Duverney.

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:56.464
Then another mad gallop,

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:58.801
hopefully with the Minister by my side,

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:02.970
to Maison Elise, and then
another night of drink.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.774
And yet more blether with
that loon of a Prince.

00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:15.195
Still, I suppose stopping
Charles' rebellion

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.529
is worth losing a bit of sleep.

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:24.830
You've lost more than a little
bit of sleep, I'm afraid.

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:26.624
Ah, (SPEAKS GAELIC), Sassenach.

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:30.208
I'll get to close my eyes on the
journey back to the palace.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.755
But, I appreciate your concern.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.842
I ken. I reek of smoke.

00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:39.344
Mm, and cheap perfume.

00:04:39.368 --> 00:04:41.763
Doesn't exactly help
my morning sickness.

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:43.932
I hung my head out of the
carriage on the way here,

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:47.394
but it was all for naught, it appears.

00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:48.979
Go back to sleep, Sassenach.

00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:51.356
You and the bairn need rest.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.901
Ye've time before you join
Louise and the ladies for tea.

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:57.402
I would not want to be late for tea.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.958
Ah, it's a tedious business, I grant ye.

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:10.895
You never know, today could
be the day you learn

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.305
some bit of vital information
that could stop the chances

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:17.261
of Charles' rebellion from
happening, once and for all.

00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.013
Well, who's going to give up
this vital piece of information?

00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:23.183
Louise? Madame Geyer?

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:25.853
Christ, I don't believe it.

00:05:25.877 --> 00:05:28.689
He's gone.

00:05:28.713 --> 00:05:32.357
Sawney. Had him since I was a wee lad.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:34.820
Look, I'm sure he's
around here somewhere.

00:05:34.844 --> 00:05:36.697
Have the servants search
the house, Sassenach,

00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.742
for a wee wooden snake about yon size.

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:41.201
Don't worry.

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:42.870
We'll give the house a
thorough going-over.

00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:44.452
I'll leave it in your capable hands.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.428
Give my regards to your ladies at tea.

00:05:55.465 --> 00:05:58.049
They're not my ladies.

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:16.073
I can't marry a Frenchman!

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.697
Why, is there something
wrong with Frenchmen?

00:06:21.989 --> 00:06:24.284
You don't know about Frenchmen?

00:06:24.308 --> 00:06:26.992
How they...

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.829
You are English. Do you know
what she's talking about?

00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:32.333
I'm afraid I don't.

00:06:32.357 --> 00:06:35.668
Well, of course you wouldn't.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.090
You're husband's so
g-gentle and so kind.

00:06:39.114 --> 00:06:40.425
I mean, I...

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.477
I know he doesn't trouble you in...
that way.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.768
Mary, do you mean...

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.853
W-what they do in b-bed.

00:06:55.297 --> 00:06:56.856
My maid said that a...

00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:58.776
a Frenchman's "thing," you know,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.737
they put it right between a lady's legs.

00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:03.114
I mean, right up inside her.

00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:05.950
- No!
- Yes!

00:07:05.974 --> 00:07:09.329
An Englishman, or even a Scot...

00:07:09.353 --> 00:07:11.956
Oh, I didn't mean it in that way,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.208
but a man like your husband,

00:07:14.232 --> 00:07:16.711
surely he'd never dream
of forcing his wife

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.464
to endure something like that.

00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.586
Mary, I believe we need

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.671
to have a little talk.

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:35.216
Men don't do things like
that where I come from.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.135
And where is that?

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.095
The moon?

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:44.056
Seaford. In Sussex.

00:07:46.027 --> 00:07:47.937
I found this in the, uh...

00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.273
the attic of my grandmother's
house in Sussex.

00:07:50.297 --> 00:07:52.859
So even your
grandmother was a historian.

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:54.819
Well, all families recorded

00:07:54.843 --> 00:07:57.739
the births, deaths, and
marriages in the front

00:07:57.763 --> 00:07:59.699
- of the family Bible.
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:01.741
This one only goes back
seven generations,

00:08:01.743 --> 00:08:04.162
but according to this,

00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:09.042
your beloved husband
got his start in 1746,

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:11.669
when Jonathon Wolverton Randall...

00:08:11.693 --> 00:08:14.714
Married Miss Mary Hawkins.

00:08:14.738 --> 00:08:16.383
Ma chère, Claire.

00:08:16.407 --> 00:08:18.343
Are you all right?

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:20.976
I hope I didn't upset you.

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:29.312
Somewhere in the back of my mind

00:08:29.336 --> 00:08:31.105
I must have known.

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:34.192
If Jack Randall had really
died at Wentworth Prison,

00:08:34.216 --> 00:08:37.320
he obviously could not
later wed Mary Hawkins

00:08:37.344 --> 00:08:40.279
and sire Frank's direct ancestor.

00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.200
And in that case,

00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:44.950
Frank himself would never exist.

00:08:47.004 --> 00:08:51.042
Perhaps I hadn't allowed myself
to think about it until now,

00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:53.086
but I was faced with
the terrible knowledge

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.068
that Frank's very existence
now depended on Jack living

00:08:57.092 --> 00:08:59.677
for at least another year.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.908
Welcome home, Madame.

00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:21.993
In your absence, you
received three invitations

00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:24.829
to dinner parties and
salons for the next week.

00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:27.582
A thank you card arrived
from Madame Cholbi

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:30.502
and the search for the little,
wooden snake creature continues,

00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:31.920
but no success as yet,

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:34.631
and I-I found this in the kitchen.

00:09:34.655 --> 00:09:37.632
I believe it is yours?

00:09:39.636 --> 00:09:41.686
I gave this to Suzette to mend.

00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:47.560
Suzette?

00:09:47.584 --> 00:09:49.271
Did I not ask you to mend...

00:09:54.258 --> 00:09:57.112
Did you need something, milady?

00:10:02.158 --> 00:10:04.125
No.

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:25.265
I won't apologize for spending
time with your lady's maid,

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:27.016
if ye have a mind to reproach me.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.685
What you do with your
time is your own concern.

00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.983
Aye, it is.

00:10:35.007 --> 00:10:39.026
But, don't you have anything
else you could be doing?

00:10:39.028 --> 00:10:41.529
I know Suzette certainly does.

00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:43.533
It is the middle of the day, after all.

00:10:43.557 --> 00:10:46.661
As a matter of fact, I don't.

00:10:46.685 --> 00:10:48.830
Since when did you become
such a priggish scold

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:50.665
when it comes to frolicking
between the sheets?

00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:52.959
You can mind you own bloody business,

00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:54.875
and remember who runs this house!

00:11:00.383 --> 00:11:02.385
Murtagh, I'm...

00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:04.179
I'm sorry. That was unforgivably rude.

00:11:04.203 --> 00:11:06.181
I'm just...

00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:08.723
not myself.

00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:22.781
No.

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:24.822
No, you're not.

00:11:37.086 --> 00:11:41.758
- Jack Randall is alive.
- What?

00:11:41.782 --> 00:11:45.678
No. I saw him lying
dead with my own eyes,

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:48.848
he was bleeding on the stone
floor of Wentworth Prison.

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:51.184
Apparently he has made...

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:54.813
a miraculous recovery.

00:11:54.837 --> 00:11:57.607
When we were at Versailles, I...

00:11:57.631 --> 00:12:01.110
spoke with the Duke's secretary,

00:12:01.134 --> 00:12:03.911
who, as it happens, is Alex Randall...

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:08.833
His brother.

00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:14.416
Recovered?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.210
"Injured in the line of
duty" was how he put it.

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.128
Jesus wept.

00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:22.179
Randall really is the Devil's spawn.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.638
- Ye... Ye havena told Jamie?
- No.

00:12:28.662 --> 00:12:31.099
- Good.
- Is it?

00:12:31.123 --> 00:12:33.935
Aye, unless ye want him
running back to Scotland

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:35.812
to seek his vengeance

00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:39.023
and that would most likely end
up with Jamie being arrested

00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:42.066
and hanged whether he
kills Randall or not.

00:12:44.403 --> 00:12:47.907
But I'm living a lie.

00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.369
Hey.

00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:54.289
You're keeping a secret to save his life

00:12:54.313 --> 00:12:57.667
and if it keeps the lad from
running off in a blind fury

00:12:57.691 --> 00:12:59.961
only to meet his maker
at the end of a rope,

00:12:59.985 --> 00:13:02.253
I'll be keeping that secret with ye.

00:13:03.973 --> 00:13:06.173
Thank you.

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:10.845
Aye.

00:13:12.348 --> 00:13:15.351
Now, if you don't mind,

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:18.402
I have some business
with yer maid to finish.

00:13:22.992 --> 00:13:26.946
I don't suppose you've ever
thought of birth control?

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.492
Control?

00:13:30.516 --> 00:13:34.034
Never mind. I'll pick up
something for Suzette.

00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:56.891
Our involvement in Austria
has depleted our resources.

00:13:56.893 --> 00:14:00.188
The King is not inclined to
fund another foreign adventure,

00:14:00.212 --> 00:14:03.107
but I'm here to play chess,
not to debate politics,

00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:06.901
and I will have you in three moves.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.040
What is politics...

00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:17.539
But chess on a grand scale?

00:14:17.563 --> 00:14:20.542
How long have you been planning that?

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:23.250
Since you opened with a Spanish game.

00:14:26.138 --> 00:14:29.008
I'm going to get you.

00:14:29.032 --> 00:14:30.391
Check.

00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:37.433
Huh.

00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:52.991
The game is yours... again.

00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:55.199
You played well.

00:14:56.953 --> 00:14:59.455
But, if I may return

00:14:59.479 --> 00:15:01.916
to more pressing matters.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.502
When you and I first met, you
offered to be of service

00:15:04.526 --> 00:15:07.129
if ever I needed you.

00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:10.800
You know, James, if you desire my help,

00:15:10.824 --> 00:15:13.970
it would not be a bad idea to
lose a game once in a while.

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:16.889
I respect you too much to
allow such a cheap victory.

00:15:16.913 --> 00:15:19.183
I give you permission
to respect me less.

00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:25.029
Now, how can I be of service?

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:30.067
Tell Prince Charles what you told me.

00:15:34.156 --> 00:15:36.323
That King Louis has no intention

00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:38.158
of funding the rebellion.

00:15:39.412 --> 00:15:41.122
You want to discourage Prince Charles

00:15:41.146 --> 00:15:44.331
from mounting your rebellion?

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:46.961
Why?

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:50.087
Scotland and our people cannot
bear another failed rebellion.

00:15:52.174 --> 00:15:54.343
We must not invade until we're certain

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.144
we have the resources
and finances to win.

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:03.061
As Minister, I cannot speak officially

00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:05.605
to the emissary of a monarch
not recognized by The King.

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:08.188
- You know that.
- Of course,

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.318
but if you were to meet
with Charles unofficially,

00:16:10.342 --> 00:16:14.030
in a place that values
discretion above all...

00:16:14.054 --> 00:16:16.991
Which would be?

00:16:17.015 --> 00:16:19.911
Maison Elise.

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:21.579
Mm.

00:16:21.603 --> 00:16:24.540
I have not been there in months.

00:16:24.564 --> 00:16:26.540
My wife...

00:16:26.542 --> 00:16:28.961
She need not know.

00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:32.296
You can honestly tell her
you're simply out with me...

00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:35.176
playing chess.

00:17:01.448 --> 00:17:04.247
Ah, Madonna!

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.663
What a pleasure to see you again.

00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:48.083
Are you always that friendly

00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:50.960
with your so-called enemies?

00:17:50.984 --> 00:17:54.294
Sometimes mutual interests
force us to associate

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:57.297
with people we do not like or trust.

00:17:57.299 --> 00:18:01.685
Please, come inside and
tell me how can I help you.

00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:06.473
I'm interested in stopping a
pregnancy from happening.

00:18:06.475 --> 00:18:08.186
Ah.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.021
It's not for me.

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:13.149
Ah, bon. Bon, bon.

00:18:13.173 --> 00:18:16.027
Well, perhaps then I would use mugwort.

00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:19.153
Delphine, can you check in the back?

00:18:19.155 --> 00:18:21.655
Aconitum Napellus.

00:18:21.657 --> 00:18:24.202
Monkshood.

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:25.787
Woop-oop-oop-oop-oop.

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:28.328
You must take care, Madame.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.041
I know this is poison.

00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:34.212
I'm not aware of any medicinal
uses for monkshood.

00:18:34.236 --> 00:18:37.423
Nor am I, Madonna.

00:18:37.447 --> 00:18:42.261
- Yet you sell it in your shop.
- I have it in my shop.

00:18:42.285 --> 00:18:46.307
What I sell to my customers who,
usually in a moment of passion,

00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:50.686
want to poison their
enemies, is bitter cascara.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.772
The effect is most immediate.

00:18:52.796 --> 00:18:56.692
The stomach seeks to
purge itself, and...

00:18:56.716 --> 00:18:59.195
then, well, you get the idea.

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:01.530
Then it makes the enemy suffer visibly,

00:19:01.554 --> 00:19:03.197
but it doesn't kill them.

00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:04.784
Precisely.

00:19:04.808 --> 00:19:08.830
Poisoner attributes the recovery
to the intervention of a priest

00:19:08.854 --> 00:19:11.165
or some sort of counter-spell.

00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:14.293
No one dies, and the
customer is satisfied.

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:15.670
So, you're a canny businessman

00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:19.632
and a humanitarian.

00:19:19.656 --> 00:19:23.803
Who is the contraceptive
for, if I may ask?

00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:26.722
- My lady's maid.
- Oh.

00:19:26.746 --> 00:19:29.225
It is usually the other way around.

00:19:29.249 --> 00:19:31.352
The maid buys a
preventative for her lady

00:19:31.376 --> 00:19:35.564
so the lady can maintain
the pretense of fidelity.

00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:38.198
Well, I am an unusual lady.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.655
Or, at least, I used to be.

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:52.746
What, madam?

00:19:52.748 --> 00:19:54.831
Oh, it's nothing.

00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:02.783
I feel since I've come to Paris...

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:06.579
my life has got more and more
conventional by the day,

00:20:06.603 --> 00:20:08.629
as, I suppose, have I...

00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:15.521
But it's of no concern.

00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:18.733
I wonder if you have ever considered

00:20:18.757 --> 00:20:21.802
putting your medical talents to use?

00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:24.655
L'Hôpital des Anges is
always looking for help.

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:26.448
What is L'Hôpital des Anges?

00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:30.286
The charity hospital
down near the cathedral.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.581
The nuns who run it do their best,

00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:36.590
but they must rely on
medical volunteers.

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:41.878
Not all of them as perceptive as you...

00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:46.433
Or as in need of helping others.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.523
For your maid.

00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.894
This is why ye rushed home and
harried me along with ye?

00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:20.736
You don't even have to come inside.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.486
You can stay here with the carriage.

00:21:22.488 --> 00:21:24.281
Jamie will not like this.

00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:26.373
He'll be happy if I'm happy.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.378
Or you'll be needing to go in there.

00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:53.602
Broch Tuarach?

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:01.748
And how can we help you, Madam?

00:23:01.772 --> 00:23:04.624
Is one of your servants here today?

00:23:04.626 --> 00:23:07.087
No, as I mentioned earlier
to Sister Angelique,

00:23:07.111 --> 00:23:09.796
I have some medical skills I
thought might be useful here.

00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:12.715
Indeed.

00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:07.272
It was urine, undoubtedly,

00:24:07.296 --> 00:24:11.234
but without chemical tests,
or even litmus paper,

00:24:11.258 --> 00:24:14.279
what conceivable use
could a urine sample be?

00:24:14.303 --> 00:24:18.033
Can you tell from what
she suffers, Madam?

00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:19.916
Possibly.

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:43.808
I suspected the
cause straight away,

00:24:43.832 --> 00:24:45.224
but I took a moment to recall

00:24:45.226 --> 00:24:49.106
the 18th century term for diabetes.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.147
I believe she has...

00:24:53.868 --> 00:24:56.154
Sugar sickness.

00:24:56.178 --> 00:24:58.905
And can you tell whether
she will recover?

00:25:05.964 --> 00:25:07.749
She won't.

00:25:07.773 --> 00:25:09.715
I'm afraid she won't last the month.

00:25:11.252 --> 00:25:15.006
This is what Monsieur Parnelle said.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.675
I have never seen a woman

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:20.843
who knew the science of urinoscopy.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.765
Perhaps you could help Sister Angelique

00:25:25.767 --> 00:25:28.901
dress the wounds of a
young boy with Scrofula?

00:25:50.941 --> 00:25:53.086
His Majesty has seen fit to approve

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.129
the Spanish crown's request
for a sizeable loan,

00:25:56.131 --> 00:25:57.964
which, in turn...

00:25:57.966 --> 00:25:59.926
has seen French merchants,

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.345
uh, taking their businesses
out of the country

00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:06.266
to avoid tax increases
we have had to levy.

00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:10.103
I understand completely, Monsieur.

00:26:10.127 --> 00:26:11.811
Wars are expensive.

00:26:11.813 --> 00:26:15.692
Aye. Very expensive. In blood and gold.

00:26:15.716 --> 00:26:17.194
Exactly.

00:26:17.218 --> 00:26:19.196
Which is why I would never approach

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.988
His Majesty, King Louis,
with empty promises

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.406
or empty pockets.

00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:29.873
Rest assured,

00:26:29.897 --> 00:26:33.166
I have already secured the
vast majority of funds

00:26:33.168 --> 00:26:34.967
for our cause.

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.009
You have?

00:26:43.011 --> 00:26:44.721
Oh, yes.

00:26:44.745 --> 00:26:48.514
Funds nearly sufficient to
finance our entire campaign.

00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:56.024
I see.

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.485
Perhaps I misunderstood the
position of Your Highness.

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:01.277
I hope you will forgive my error.

00:27:03.531 --> 00:27:06.076
I have been in secret negotiations

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.120
with several wealthy
and highly-influential

00:27:09.144 --> 00:27:11.248
members of the British aristocracy

00:27:11.272 --> 00:27:13.917
who believe my father
is the rightful heir

00:27:13.941 --> 00:27:16.044
to the English throne.

00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:18.044
Mark me,

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:20.840
these patriots are willing
to fund his return to glory,

00:27:20.864 --> 00:27:23.216
and have already pledged
an amount to the cause

00:27:23.218 --> 00:27:27.470
nearly sufficient to accomplish
that divine purpose.

00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:35.394
My friend James is astonished.

00:27:37.565 --> 00:27:40.151
I cannot tell you how happy I am

00:27:40.175 --> 00:27:43.903
to see the look of relief and
shock upon your face, James.

00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:48.076
Those are the very words, Your Highness.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.538
"Relief and shock."

00:27:51.562 --> 00:27:55.831
I, too, share in, uh, happy edification.

00:27:57.468 --> 00:28:01.420
But, Highness, in light
of this, uh, happy news,

00:28:01.422 --> 00:28:05.925
I must ask as to the role
you see for my King?

00:28:05.927 --> 00:28:08.928
Should King Louis support our cause,

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.264
I offer France an alliance with Britain

00:28:11.266 --> 00:28:14.600
in the aftermath of victory.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.943
Britain and France

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:24.610
allies?

00:28:24.612 --> 00:28:29.033
Oh, it would change the world, Highness.

00:28:29.057 --> 00:28:32.579
Yes, but France will have
to stand with us now.

00:28:32.603 --> 00:28:35.873
Add your funds to what
I've already secured.

00:28:35.897 --> 00:28:37.959
Help me secure victory.

00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:40.587
Close the gap between what
I have and what I need

00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:43.045
and I will give you the world.

00:28:54.642 --> 00:28:56.603
I will speak to the King on your behalf,

00:28:56.627 --> 00:28:59.439
but I will first need some evidence

00:28:59.463 --> 00:29:04.150
of your English patriots
and their "ample funds."

00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:08.704
And you shall have it.

00:29:14.996 --> 00:29:17.496
- Let us celebrate.
- Hm.

00:29:41.322 --> 00:29:43.322
Claire?

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.360
Claire!

00:29:54.202 --> 00:29:56.035
Suzette!

00:30:02.343 --> 00:30:03.376
Yes, Milord.

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:07.299
She has not returned since she went out

00:30:07.322 --> 00:30:09.215
with Monsieur Murtagh this afternoon.

00:30:13.187 --> 00:30:15.054
Merci.

00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:02.603
Jamie?

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.355
I'm so glad you're here.

00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:06.566
I've had the most wonderful day.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:10.027
I lanced two boils,
changed filthy dressings,

00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:13.112
and saw my first case
of full-blown Scrofula.

00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:15.700
The carriage ride home was
full of delightful tales

00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:18.369
of blood and pus and
gangrenous toenails.

00:31:18.393 --> 00:31:19.704
Where have you been?

00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:22.085
Certainly not at Madame
Louise's for tea.

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:24.129
At L'Hôpital des Anges.

00:31:24.153 --> 00:31:26.544
Do you know it?

00:31:26.568 --> 00:31:28.421
The charity hospital?

00:31:28.445 --> 00:31:29.672
Aye.

00:31:29.696 --> 00:31:31.341
What took you there?

00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:33.682
I'll just go and find
myself something to eat.

00:31:35.603 --> 00:31:37.520
I told ye he wouldn't like it.

00:31:40.475 --> 00:31:43.809
I heard they were in need
of people with my skills.

00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:47.482
So, as I had time today,
I went and volunteered.

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:49.317
Mother Hildegarde, she's the matron,

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:52.069
she's a complete force of nature.

00:31:52.093 --> 00:31:55.823
She was a musical
prodigy and goddaughter

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:59.325
of King Louis' great-grandfather.

00:31:59.327 --> 00:32:01.412
She's not going to make it easy for me,

00:32:01.436 --> 00:32:04.330
but when she saw me taste the urine,

00:32:04.332 --> 00:32:07.166
the tides began to turn.

00:32:07.168 --> 00:32:10.252
I haven't won her over yet, but I will.

00:32:16.677 --> 00:32:18.596
What's the matter?

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.098
I thought you'd be happy for me.

00:32:21.122 --> 00:32:23.226
Did ye now?

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.685
Well, yes, I did.

00:32:26.687 --> 00:32:28.354
What's wrong?

00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:30.573
You're with child, for one.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.528
You could catch a filthy disease.

00:32:37.532 --> 00:32:39.698
What of the bairn?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.202
Have you not thought of that?

00:32:41.226 --> 00:32:44.497
Of course I've thought of the baby.

00:32:44.521 --> 00:32:48.459
I would only treat patients
that have injury, not diseases.

00:32:48.483 --> 00:32:50.795
Or at least diseases I
know I can't catch.

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:52.845
Why take the chance?

00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:59.554
It has been a long time
since I have felt useful.

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:03.641
I need to feel a sense
of accomplishment.

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:05.560
I need a purpose.

00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:07.812
Purpose?

00:33:07.836 --> 00:33:10.729
I thought our purpose for being
in this godforsaken city

00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:12.731
was to stop the rebellion.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.949
It is. That hasn't changed.

00:33:19.973 --> 00:33:23.703
Then tell me, how will lancing
boils and tasting urine

00:33:23.727 --> 00:33:25.411
help us to save Scotland?

00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:30.918
Well, what would you have me do, Jamie?

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:33.880
Go to Maison Elise with you and Charles?

00:33:33.904 --> 00:33:37.675
Or do you want me to run the
wine business in your place?

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.761
What I want, when I come
home with a problem,

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:43.512
is to be able to turn
to my wife for help.

00:33:47.735 --> 00:33:51.270
Tonight, The Prince told Mr. Duverney

00:33:51.272 --> 00:33:53.606
that he's secured significant funding

00:33:53.608 --> 00:33:55.276
from several prominent Englishmen

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.694
with which to fund the rebellion.

00:33:56.718 --> 00:33:59.612
Could that be true?

00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:06.335
But The Prince offered Duverney
an alliance with England.

00:34:07.622 --> 00:34:09.707
All I could do was sit there

00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:13.628
as the wine turned sour in my stomach.

00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:15.546
But that's impossible.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.258
Britain and France won't become
allies for another century.

00:34:19.282 --> 00:34:22.301
All I know is Charles is
more canny than he seems.

00:34:23.304 --> 00:34:25.682
He's keeping secrets,

00:34:25.706 --> 00:34:27.724
(SPEAKS GAELIC) what to do about it.

00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:35.364
I'm sorry, Jamie. Truly, I am.

00:34:36.984 --> 00:34:39.820
I know this
has all been my idea:

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:42.538
changing the future,
stopping the rebellion...

00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:48.621
and right now, all of
it, it falls on you,

00:34:48.645 --> 00:34:52.748
but I will try and help you
in any way that I can.

00:34:53.834 --> 00:34:55.461
So I believed.

00:34:55.485 --> 00:34:57.970
That's why I came home looking for you.

00:34:59.724 --> 00:35:01.926
Instead, you were out indulging yourself

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.842
with poultices and potions.

00:35:11.852 --> 00:35:13.938
I assure you,

00:35:13.962 --> 00:35:17.692
there was no indulging involved.

00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:20.528
I was helping people.

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:23.362
But yes, that makes me feel good,

00:35:23.364 --> 00:35:25.366
gives my day meaning.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.077
What about me?

00:35:28.101 --> 00:35:31.330
I spend my days and nights
wheedling and flattering a man

00:35:31.354 --> 00:35:35.292
so I can gain his secrets
and undermine his cause.

00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:37.712
When do I get to feel good?

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:40.379
When do I get to find meaning in my day?

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.199
I knew that wasn't gonna go well.

00:36:06.223 --> 00:36:07.867
So sad.

00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:09.326
How can there be love in the marriage

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.745
when love leaves the bed?

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.663
Huh?

00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:15.748
A lady's maid knows what
does, and does not,

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.800
occur in her mistress' boudoir.

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:29.988
Ooh!

00:38:45.164 --> 00:38:48.047
First of all, I'm a
dirty Scottish bastard.

00:38:52.072 --> 00:38:53.950
Okay, then. Take me to the police

00:38:53.974 --> 00:38:57.119
- and I will find your wife.
- Ah, you speak English.

00:38:57.143 --> 00:38:59.246
And I will tell her that
you rut with whores.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.250
No, no, no. No police.

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.294
And my wife would not believe you,

00:39:05.318 --> 00:39:08.172
but Madam Elise will
likely not appreciate

00:39:08.196 --> 00:39:10.841
having a thief for a servant boy.

00:39:10.865 --> 00:39:12.551
N-n-not Madame Elise, no.

00:39:12.575 --> 00:39:14.178
Please, she... she will kill me

00:39:14.202 --> 00:39:16.305
if she thinks I steal
from her customers.

00:39:16.329 --> 00:39:19.264
Aye, she's not a forgiving kind.

00:39:20.935 --> 00:39:23.103
I don't do it every night.

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:24.688
J-Just when we are very busy

00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:26.939
and, like, the gentlemen are very drunk.

00:39:26.941 --> 00:39:29.193
I'm not interested in your methods,

00:39:29.217 --> 00:39:32.767
but I am interested in you.

00:39:32.791 --> 00:39:34.602
Hey, I-I'm no whore.

00:39:34.615 --> 00:39:38.285
I... I don't want that, either.

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.285
Then what?

00:39:42.957 --> 00:39:46.291
I want to offer you a job, ye wee fool.

00:39:46.293 --> 00:39:48.004
A job?

00:39:48.028 --> 00:39:50.130
Doing what?

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:53.131
Exactly what you have been doing.

00:39:53.133 --> 00:39:54.718
Put me down!

00:39:54.742 --> 00:39:56.595
Stop!

00:39:58.973 --> 00:40:00.975
You can keep all of this,

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:02.726
but from now on,

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.060
you're going to do all
your stealing for me.

00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:16.872
You wee bastard. That's my snake.

00:40:18.409 --> 00:40:20.292
How much do you pay?

00:40:58.165 --> 00:41:00.198
Who the hell are you?

00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:04.169
What are you doing in my house?

00:41:13.797 --> 00:41:15.430
You said the same thing to Suzette.

00:41:17.301 --> 00:41:19.011
That doesn't make me feel very special.

00:41:19.035 --> 00:41:22.681
But the ladies at Maison
Elise were always very...

00:41:22.705 --> 00:41:25.392
very generous when I
give them compliments.

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.893
So was Suzette. She gave
him the chicken leg.

00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:29.438
Yeah.

00:41:29.462 --> 00:41:30.981
Well, that's very interesting,

00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:33.065
but I still don't know who you are.

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:35.734
Take him up to the servants'
quarters, Murtagh.

00:41:35.736 --> 00:41:37.029
Suzette is preparing a bath

00:41:37.053 --> 00:41:39.198
and has some nightclothes
for him to wear.

00:41:39.222 --> 00:41:41.200
Wait.

00:41:41.224 --> 00:41:44.286
Good night, Madame.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.872
Ah, Christ.

00:41:46.896 --> 00:41:48.914
And watch your (SPEAKS GAELIC).

00:41:52.503 --> 00:41:55.422
Bed and bath?

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:58.384
He's a pickpocket. His name's Fergus.

00:41:58.408 --> 00:42:00.386
Well, actually it's
Claudel, but we agreed

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:01.927
that wasna very manly.

00:42:01.929 --> 00:42:04.223
So, you invited him into our house?

00:42:04.247 --> 00:42:07.226
I hired him from Maison Elise.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.934
Hired him?

00:42:10.771 --> 00:42:13.440
Because every fine house needs
a pickpocket, I suppose?

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.317
It's part of my plan.

00:42:15.341 --> 00:42:17.194
We need information that
I cannot get directly

00:42:17.218 --> 00:42:19.029
from The Prince.

00:42:19.053 --> 00:42:20.781
Information that comes
in the form of letters

00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:24.952
from his father, from other
potential financiers,

00:42:24.976 --> 00:42:28.205
and most importantly, from
these wealthy Englishmen,

00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:31.167
if they do even exist.

00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:33.085
So, Fergus steals the letters, and...

00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:34.960
Aye, and we copy them,

00:42:34.962 --> 00:42:37.381
and then he puts them back
before anyone notices

00:42:37.405 --> 00:42:38.964
they've gone missing.

00:42:42.302 --> 00:42:43.969
That's a good plan.

00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:47.806
Thank you.

00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:53.395
Well, good night.

00:43:11.498 --> 00:43:14.084
As the days
passed, our house settled

00:43:14.108 --> 00:43:16.334
into a routine that kept us all busy.

00:43:16.336 --> 00:43:20.049
Fergus spent his time,
with Murtagh's help,

00:43:20.073 --> 00:43:23.058
stealing letters to and from The Prince.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.190
Jamie's days were spent out
with Prince Charles...

00:43:36.214 --> 00:43:37.858
Now, we drink.

00:43:37.882 --> 00:43:39.359
Who continued
to be long in rhetoric

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:41.109
and short on specifics.

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:49.912
My days, in between social engagements,

00:43:49.936 --> 00:43:52.039
were spent in the hospital

00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:54.083
where I began to develop an appreciation

00:43:54.107 --> 00:43:56.958
of Mother Hildegarde's
medical knowledge.

00:44:00.947 --> 00:44:03.926
Jamie and Murtagh's time was
spent trying to piece together

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.218
the puzzle of the Jacobite rebellion

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.139
and discover if there really
was an English conspiracy

00:44:09.163 --> 00:44:10.889
willing to fund the cause,

00:44:10.891 --> 00:44:13.352
or if it was all a ruse
by a desperate prince

00:44:13.376 --> 00:44:16.438
trying to restore his father's throne.

00:44:16.462 --> 00:44:19.231
He must get these letters
back to the tavern

00:44:19.233 --> 00:44:20.943
before they're missed.

00:44:20.967 --> 00:44:23.654
Is that King James'
signature at the bottom?

00:44:23.678 --> 00:44:26.657
I recognize his hand, by now.

00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:28.657
Everything else is in code.

00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:33.580
The seal had been removed
at least three times

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:35.165
before I took it off myself.

00:44:35.189 --> 00:44:36.625
Yeah, we're not the only ones interested

00:44:36.649 --> 00:44:39.134
in the Stuart correspondence.

00:44:40.637 --> 00:44:42.587
Can you decode it?

00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:44.967
Most of the codes are fairly simple.

00:44:44.991 --> 00:44:49.594
Usually only talking about
family gossip and such.

00:44:49.596 --> 00:44:52.430
Suppose they'd rather
not let anyone know.

00:44:52.432 --> 00:44:55.477
I think I can work this one out.

00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:58.236
When I can see straight, that is.

00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:15.122
Wha... What the devil is this?

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:17.624
It's music, ye dolt.

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:20.544
I know music when I see it.

00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:23.255
But what's it doing in a letter?

00:45:23.279 --> 00:45:25.630
I was trying to puzzle
that one out, myself.

00:45:25.632 --> 00:45:28.051
"A Song of the Country."

00:45:28.075 --> 00:45:31.597
The lyrics are about a
bonnie day in a meadow.

00:45:31.621 --> 00:45:33.098
Just another code?

00:45:33.122 --> 00:45:35.475
Maybe, but nothing in the code

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:37.642
has anything to do with the notes.

00:45:37.644 --> 00:45:40.564
Maybe it's not a code.

00:45:40.588 --> 00:45:43.942
Perhaps some German friend
of Charles just sent him

00:45:43.966 --> 00:45:45.444
a piece of music to enjoy.

00:45:45.468 --> 00:45:48.322
Aye, but this message is in German,

00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:49.788
but was sent from England.

00:45:54.544 --> 00:45:56.544
A code in music?

00:45:59.166 --> 00:46:02.085
Aye.

00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:03.670
Maybe tomorrow you can ask around

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:08.223
for a music teacher or composer
that can speak German.

00:46:12.512 --> 00:46:14.598
There's somebody I know who, uh...

00:46:14.622 --> 00:46:16.648
who might be able to read it...

00:46:18.652 --> 00:46:20.735
But you're not gonna like it.

00:46:23.607 --> 00:46:26.151
The skin is pink, with good granulation.

00:46:26.175 --> 00:46:27.736
There's no bad smells or dark streaks,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.446
but his urine is very dark and odorous,

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.695
and he's incredibly warm.

00:46:30.697 --> 00:46:33.365
Perhaps a secondary infection?

00:46:33.367 --> 00:46:36.412
Bladder or appendicitis?

00:46:36.436 --> 00:46:37.535
Mm.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.503
There's no abdominal tenderness.

00:46:44.527 --> 00:46:47.546
Bouton.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.809
No, you are right.

00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:00.776
It isn't that.

00:47:19.246 --> 00:47:21.457
But that's almost healed.

00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:22.791
It's not infected.

00:47:22.815 --> 00:47:25.085
No?

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.255
You see? A pocket of putrefaction.

00:47:30.257 --> 00:47:33.093
Shall I summon Monsieur Forez?

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:36.305
No, I can handle it.

00:47:36.329 --> 00:47:39.431
I'll need a small scalpel, some
alcohol, and cloth, please.

00:47:41.318 --> 00:47:44.146
While the tiny entrance
wound had healed cleanly,

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.857
the deeper wound had festered
and formed a pocket of pus

00:47:46.881 --> 00:47:49.735
around the intrusion,
buried in the muscle tissue

00:47:49.759 --> 00:47:52.321
where no surface
symptoms were visible...

00:47:52.345 --> 00:47:55.413
To human senses, at least.

00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:10.429
Forceps.

00:48:28.732 --> 00:48:29.858
Voila.

00:48:44.714 --> 00:48:48.293
Jamie...

00:48:48.317 --> 00:48:50.712
what are you doing here?

00:48:50.736 --> 00:48:53.256
I, uh...

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.258
I need help.

00:48:55.282 --> 00:48:58.220
Musically speaking.

00:48:58.244 --> 00:49:00.728
Well, you did say Mother
Hildegarde kens music.

00:49:04.651 --> 00:49:06.651
I was hoping...

00:49:08.605 --> 00:49:12.524
Wondering... if there was
something odd about the music.

00:49:12.526 --> 00:49:14.528
The way it's written.

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:16.194
Can you assure me what you're doing

00:49:16.196 --> 00:49:18.780
is neither illegal nor dangerous?

00:49:20.834 --> 00:49:23.203
I can assure you,

00:49:23.227 --> 00:49:26.754
if my husband is asking,
then it's for a good reason.

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:47.686
That is the basic melody.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.564
It then repeats itself in variations.

00:49:56.302 --> 00:49:57.613
You know,

00:49:57.637 --> 00:50:01.241
I have seen some things
reminiscent of this.

00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:05.537
Yes, an old German friend
of mine, Herr Bach,

00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:09.332
has done work very similar to this.

00:50:09.356 --> 00:50:12.417
Johann Sebastian Bach?

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:14.880
I'm surprised you have heard of him.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.801
He sends me things now and again.

00:50:19.825 --> 00:50:22.888
He calls them "inventions,"

00:50:22.912 --> 00:50:26.475
and they are really quite clever,

00:50:26.499 --> 00:50:30.353
but I'm afraid his music
is not the sort to endure.

00:50:30.377 --> 00:50:32.820
Clever, but no heart.

00:50:34.908 --> 00:50:39.696
This is a clumsy version of this.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.698
"Goldberg Variationen."

00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:44.326
"The Goldberg Variations."

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.286
Now, you see here,

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.998
your mysterious composer has
repeated the same melody

00:50:50.022 --> 00:50:53.793
as Herr Bach... almost...

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:56.928
but changed the key each time.

00:50:58.048 --> 00:51:00.425
The key...

00:51:00.449 --> 00:51:02.052
and that's unusual?

00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:03.512
Oh, yes.

00:51:03.536 --> 00:51:06.640
Five changes in such a short piece,

00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:08.808
and some changes for
no reason whatsoever.

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:10.308
Hm.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.893
No musical reason.

00:51:14.397 --> 00:51:15.691
The key is the key.

00:51:15.715 --> 00:51:18.568
- Aye.
- What key?

00:51:18.592 --> 00:51:19.986
The musical key.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.614
Whoever wrote this had a
diabolical sense of humor.

00:51:22.638 --> 00:51:25.367
Oh, aye, diabolical.

00:51:25.391 --> 00:51:27.659
Two flats means you take
every second letter,

00:51:27.661 --> 00:51:30.497
beginning at the start of the section.

00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.125
Three sharps means you
take every third letter,

00:51:33.149 --> 00:51:35.667
beginning at the end.

00:51:54.795 --> 00:51:56.439
Does it make sense?

00:51:56.463 --> 00:51:57.689
Aye.

00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:00.777
Aye, it does.

00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:03.027
"I have successfully
concluded negotiations

00:52:03.029 --> 00:52:04.740
with our three partners,

00:52:04.764 --> 00:52:06.742
all of whom are willing to
contribute to our cause."

00:52:06.766 --> 00:52:08.994
So, the English conspirators are real?

00:52:09.018 --> 00:52:10.453
Aye.

00:52:10.477 --> 00:52:12.455
"I can guarantee the amount of £40,000

00:52:12.479 --> 00:52:14.499
will be made available to you."

00:52:14.523 --> 00:52:15.709
£40,000.

00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:18.003
It's a sizeable amount, right enough,

00:52:18.027 --> 00:52:20.797
but it's not enough to
fund an entire war.

00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:22.880
So, Charles was lying to Duverney.

00:52:22.882 --> 00:52:24.968
Exaggerating. Duverney is smart enough

00:52:24.992 --> 00:52:28.388
to expect a certain amount of
that in a business like this.

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:31.556
40,000 may not fund the
war, but it may be enough

00:52:31.558 --> 00:52:33.059
to convince Duverney and The King

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:36.563
that the Jacobites have a chance.

00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:39.024
"I will be back in Paris
at the month's end,

00:52:39.048 --> 00:52:41.065
and am eager to finally
meet you face-to-face

00:52:41.067 --> 00:52:43.067
to solidify our arrangement."

00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:45.903
And then it's just "S."

00:52:45.905 --> 00:52:48.700
Aye. One letter left over.

00:52:48.724 --> 00:52:50.575
A signature, I reckon.

00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:58.752
- S...
- Sandringham.

00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:00.587
It's the Duke. I'm sure of it.

00:53:00.611 --> 00:53:02.920
The Duke's had secret dealings
with Dougal for years.

00:53:02.922 --> 00:53:04.883
Dougal is a committed Jacobite.

00:53:04.907 --> 00:53:06.176
He's playing both sides
against the middle.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.259
He may well be hedging
his bets for and against

00:53:08.261 --> 00:53:09.761
a Stuart restoration.

00:53:09.763 --> 00:53:12.932
If we can meet with Sandringham,

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:15.183
convince him this is a bad investment...

00:53:16.986 --> 00:53:20.772
You know what this means?

00:53:20.774 --> 00:53:22.690
We figured it out.

00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:27.906
This calls for a celebration.

00:53:29.044 --> 00:53:32.000
- Uh, whiskey...
- Sandringham, lass.

00:53:32.024 --> 00:53:35.121
If Jamie sits down with
him and his secretary,

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.873
you know what will happen.

00:53:36.897 --> 00:53:38.500
He'll find out Black Jack Randall

00:53:38.524 --> 00:53:40.124
is still alive.

00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:43.922
You need to tell him, and
you need to tell him now.

00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:50.802
I can't tell you how good
it feels to make progress

00:53:50.804 --> 00:53:53.971
after fighting feathers for so long.

00:53:55.517 --> 00:53:58.708
We still have problems to solve,

00:53:58.732 --> 00:54:01.979
but we'll solve them too.

00:54:04.901 --> 00:54:06.901
To...

00:54:08.988 --> 00:54:11.989
Mother Hildegarde,

00:54:11.991 --> 00:54:13.825
without whom

00:54:13.827 --> 00:54:15.993
our enemies would remain unknown to us.

00:54:19.799 --> 00:54:21.799
To my wife...

00:54:23.837 --> 00:54:26.804
who's always there when I need her.

00:54:41.321 --> 00:54:43.187
- I...
- What is it, Sassenach?

00:54:51.968 --> 00:54:53.968
I just love seeing you so happy.

00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:14.726
