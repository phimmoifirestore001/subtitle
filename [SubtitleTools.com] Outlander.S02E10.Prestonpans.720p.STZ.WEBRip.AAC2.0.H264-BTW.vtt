00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.190
<i>Previously...</i>

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.805
We will unite the clans and I
will lead you all to glory.

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:31.145
Charles has landed in Scotland
and is gathering his army.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.580
Then what will ye do, brother?

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.149
<i>To save our clans, our country,</i>

00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:37.018
<i>we must band together.</i>

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:39.226
Angus! Rupert!

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:42.366
Dougal! Colum
change his mind then?

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.868
Colum's mind is his own. We are here.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:46.971
<i>We'll make a fine group
of Highland soldiers.</i>

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.806
<i>It is our time.</i>

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:50.742
These are my men, my clan.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.010
They'll answer to me and no one else.

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:53.877
If you choose to fight with Clan Fraser,

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:56.848
then you'll follow my
orders without objection.

00:00:56.883 --> 00:00:58.483
I would give my life

00:00:58.518 --> 00:01:00.985
to see a Stuart back on the throne.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.721
If we have the discipline
to fight together,

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:05.857
then by God, we will win.

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:58.403
<i>How many men had
I seen killed in war?</i>

00:02:58.438 --> 00:03:00.238
<i>This Highlander</i>

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:02.407
<i>who had run afoul of a redcoat patrol</i>

00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:05.810
<i>was only the latest one.</i>

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:08.312
<i>The rebellion Jamie and I had
labored so hard to prevent</i>

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:09.914
<i>was upon us.</i>

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:16.220
<i>Our only hope was that somehow
we could change the outcome.</i>

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:22.994
<i>I feared in my heart that
history would not be rewritten.</i>

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.898
<i>That no matter how many
battles we might win,</i>

00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:30.068
<i>victory would remain
forever out of reach.</i>

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:33.871
Claire, how long do you
need to take a simple pish?

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.808
I'll be right there.

00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.477
<i>How many men had
I seen killed in war?</i>

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.055
<i>Far, far too many.</i>

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.363
There, sir. Right there is your enemy.

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.519
Yet we do nothing but sit
here and twiddle our thumbs.

00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:05.169
And what would you have the
Lord General do, John?

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:07.972
Pardon me, Quartermaster O'Sullivan.

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:10.975
Well, attack, damn it.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.877
Pardon me, Your Highness, but...
but for the life of me,

00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:15.146
I cannot understand why
General Murray insists

00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:17.281
we waste our time in dilly-dally.

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:18.850
I rushed the army here

00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:21.052
to ensure our possession
of the high ground.

00:04:21.087 --> 00:04:24.355
And now you wish us to abandon
such a strong defensive position

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.390
and attack the enemy in force?

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:28.025
Indeed I do, sir.

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.329
Time, sir. Time is of the essence.

00:04:31.364 --> 00:04:34.198
We must not tarry, Your Majesty.

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:36.634
We must strike and strike hard.

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.237
May I remind the Quartermaster

00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:42.974
any attacking force will
have to cross here,

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.942
through Tranent Meadows.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:47.011
Though "meadow" is a fancy name

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:49.647
for the bog that lies
between us and the enemy.

00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:51.849
Since when did a Scotsman

00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:53.784
shy away from a bit of mud, huh?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.019
Especially when there's
an enemy waiting for him

00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:56.787
on the other side.

00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:59.157
Since when does an Irish-born
officer dismiss the dangers

00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:00.992
of boggy ground to an infantry attack?

00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:03.528
Well, thank God. A sane voice, at last.

00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:05.329
Can you imagine, Sire?

00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:09.033
Your army wallowing helplessly
while under a withering volley

00:05:09.068 --> 00:05:11.002
from the British Brown Bess musket?

00:05:11.037 --> 00:05:13.871
A weapon deadly at 50 yards
and accurate up to 100.

00:05:13.907 --> 00:05:16.174
Cavalry could prove useful to our needs.

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.043
Both to test the ground and to
report on the enemy position.

00:05:19.078 --> 00:05:21.112
Aye, a braw squad of dragoons

00:05:21.147 --> 00:05:23.648
could mean the difference
between victory and defeat.

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:27.518
Let us not speak of defeat or
of cavalry we do not have.

00:05:27.554 --> 00:05:30.388
And as for the Lord
General, may I remind him

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:32.657
that he would be remaining
behind the lines,

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:33.891
and therefore need not be concerned

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.493
about British marksmanship.

00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:37.695
Damn my liver! What are
you implying, sir?

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.063
I imply nothing, sir.

00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:40.865
I'm merely grateful
that we are dependent

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.333
upon the bravery of our warriors...

00:05:42.368 --> 00:05:43.668
Here, here!

00:05:43.703 --> 00:05:45.903
Who are not afraid to face shot or shell

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.573
to pursue a glorious
victory for our prince

00:05:48.608 --> 00:05:49.807
and for our king.

00:05:49.842 --> 00:05:51.842
Mark me,

00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:53.945
now it is but weeks gone

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.947
since we took the cities
of Perth and Edinburgh

00:05:55.982 --> 00:06:00.284
without firing a single shot.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.287
And let us not forget,

00:06:03.323 --> 00:06:06.157
they welcomed me with open arms.

00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:08.859
Aye, but on both occasions

00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:12.363
we possessed the element of
surprise, Your Royal Highness.

00:06:12.398 --> 00:06:15.199
General Cope wasna expecting us.

00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:16.968
His troops fled.

00:06:17.003 --> 00:06:19.036
And that won't happen again, Sir.

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:22.873
Perhaps if I were to arrange
a meeting with the General?

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.311
Offer him generous terms of surrender.

00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:28.980
Give him my word

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:32.817
his men will be allowed to march
back to England unmolested.

00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:41.392
I am sure he has no more desire

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:44.862
to shed English blood than I have.

00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:49.567
We are all brothers after all.

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:51.035
Even as a young lad

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.071
you had the kindest of hearts, Sir.

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:57.975
But I fear the time for talk is done.

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.113
We sailed from France to fight a war.

00:07:02.148 --> 00:07:03.814
Let us fight...

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.017
and be done with it.

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:09.654
I will not risk destroying our army...

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.890
by ordering it to cross
potentially lethal ground.

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.625
Is that clear, sir?

00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.060
I will not allow it.

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:17.561
Then resign your commission

00:07:17.597 --> 00:07:19.630
and let the prince
find himself a general

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:20.998
with a firmer backbone!

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:22.366
You pompous toe-rag!

00:07:22.402 --> 00:07:24.201
While you two exchange insults,

00:07:24.237 --> 00:07:25.870
what do I tell Clan MacDonald?

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:28.005
Tell your men to await further orders.

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:35.579
Which may be some time.

00:07:56.235 --> 00:08:00.204
Why must the Scots be
such intractable people?

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:05.176
Aye, we can be pig-headed on occasion.

00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:07.645
On many an occasion.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.014
As can the Irish, I fear.

00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:13.284
Our cause must succeed, James.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:17.755
I promised my father, and
I have promised God.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.491
Mark me.

00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:23.894
Your noble wife will be among
those providing medical succor

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.696
for those poor souls in need of such

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:27.198
come the cannon's roar?

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:30.901
Aye, she's helping to
set up a field hospital

00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:33.537
even as we speak, Your Royal Highness.

00:08:33.573 --> 00:08:35.139
Be so kind to tell her

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:38.376
the prince asks that British
casualties be tended to

00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.044
before the Jacobite wounded.

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:42.680
The British are my
father's subjects also,

00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:45.316
and I will have them well cared for.

00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.719
They must be made to realize
the Scots wage war upon them

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:51.155
with the greatest of reluctance.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.724
They are our enemies
now, but one day soon

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.493
they will be our friends again.

00:08:55.528 --> 00:08:57.368
I'm afraid the British
have never been a friend

00:08:57.397 --> 00:08:59.397
to the Scots.

00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:04.869
But as your friend,

00:09:04.904 --> 00:09:07.171
I would advise you not
to speak of such things

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:08.973
within earshot of the men.

00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:12.943
They would not appreciate
such sentiment.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:15.146
Nor do I believe would my wife

00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.649
follow such an order.

00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:22.686
From her prince, perhaps not.

00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:26.624
But surely Lady Broch Tuarach

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.827
would prove obedient to an edict
from her lord and master.

00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:34.398
Aye.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.850
Enough!

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:31.822
"Enough," ye say?

00:10:31.858 --> 00:10:33.290
That's what he said, all right.

00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:35.693
I heard it with these very ears.

00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:36.994
The ale ye waste now

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:39.497
is ale ye'll probably be wanting later.

00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:41.065
Quench the thirst of battle.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.400
"The thirst of battle," ye say?

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:46.036
What would ye two cotters
ken of battle, eh?

00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:47.671
Cotters we may be,

00:10:47.707 --> 00:10:49.874
but we're here, same as you.

00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:51.542
For gore and glory.

00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:53.644
Gore and glory, is it?

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:55.312
There's no pigs ye're slaughtering here,

00:10:55.348 --> 00:10:56.847
but men.

00:10:56.883 --> 00:10:58.949
And they'll be looking
to do the same to you.

00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:01.018
We know our task,

00:11:01.053 --> 00:11:02.953
and we'll do what needs doing

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:04.855
to return the king across the water.

00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:06.190
Will ye now?

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:09.627
I bet ye Lallybroch
tumshies will turn arse

00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:12.863
and run at first blast of cannon fire.

00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:14.865
Ye take that back, ye
buggering wee shite!

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.534
Hey, ye fancy a doing?

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:19.069
Come on, I'll open ye from
yer belly to yer bone!

00:11:19.105 --> 00:11:21.038
Put that blade down

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:24.074
or I'll ram it up yer
arse until ye taste it.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.478
Ye try it, ye bushy-faced whoreson!

00:11:27.513 --> 00:11:29.013
For the love of Christ,

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:32.850
how can a man nap with
all this blathering?

00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:39.290
Is that a dirk I see in yer hand?

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:41.325
Angus.

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:50.868
See yer getting on as
well as our commanders.

00:11:50.903 --> 00:11:54.004
Have we orders, Jamie?

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.507
No. Nor are we likely to

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:57.808
while the general and O'Sullivan

00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:59.310
remain hopping mad at each other.

00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:00.978
It sounds like someone
in the front ranks

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:03.547
could do with a good arse kicking, eh?

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:06.517
If only that was all was needed.

00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:08.852
What is required

00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:10.788
is a reconnaissance of the marshland

00:12:10.823 --> 00:12:14.391
that sits between us
and the British camp.

00:12:14.427 --> 00:12:16.393
Discover if the ground is solid enough

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:17.728
for our army to cross.

00:12:17.763 --> 00:12:19.363
So the plan is for us to attack?

00:12:19.398 --> 00:12:22.366
If the Quartermaster has his way.

00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:24.735
Though I'm of a mind it's
the better part of valor

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.005
to force the British to come to us.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.075
But not even O'Sullivan
will countenance an attack

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.010
until the question of
the ground is solved.

00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:36.046
To undertake such a mission

00:12:36.082 --> 00:12:38.449
under the very guns of our enemies

00:12:38.484 --> 00:12:42.620
will be naught but suicide.

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:45.122
So, eat yer fill and rest up.

00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:48.392
Save the whisky for when we
have cause to celebrate.

00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:50.427
Dougal, a word.

00:13:06.012 --> 00:13:08.779
It would be an easy thing
to have someone ride out

00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:10.347
to take a measure of the marshland?

00:13:10.383 --> 00:13:12.883
And get a musket ball between
the eyes for their trouble.

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.686
Not if he's prudent.

00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:17.955
And lucky.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.657
There's no other way about it.

00:13:19.692 --> 00:13:21.892
If the ground can support
a man on horseback,

00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:25.629
it can support infantry.

00:13:25.665 --> 00:13:28.065
And, uh,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.701
is it yerself ye're nominating?

00:13:30.736 --> 00:13:33.704
'Cause if ye survive such foolishness,

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:36.040
the prince would have yer
head for endangering the life

00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:37.541
of one of his most trusted aides.

00:13:37.576 --> 00:13:40.044
Hmm. Aye.

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.311
He would not be best pleased.

00:13:41.347 --> 00:13:42.746
No.

00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:47.685
Still and all,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.753
someone has to risk the doing.

00:13:54.226 --> 00:13:58.862
And all I need to do is stay
out of range of their guns.

00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:02.032
125 yards should do it.

00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:06.303
I was thinking more 105.

00:14:06.338 --> 00:14:08.539
The redcoats will only be
too happy to crack away

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:09.907
at a living, breathing target.

00:14:09.942 --> 00:14:11.241
Oh, aye, it's a gamble,

00:14:11.277 --> 00:14:12.943
but it's worth the risk.

00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:15.045
Besides,

00:14:15.081 --> 00:14:17.047
I'd like to prove my
mettle to the prince

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:18.882
and Lord Murray

00:14:18.918 --> 00:14:21.151
and the rest of these jackanapes.

00:14:25.191 --> 00:14:27.524
So then,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.993
125 yards?

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:32.029
Or thereabouts.

00:15:23.883 --> 00:15:25.215
Here, look.

00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:28.385
<i>All right, men.</i>

00:15:31.023 --> 00:15:33.023
<i>Come on, then, to ranks.</i>

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.829
<i>Load.</i>

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:54.978
Extraordinary fellow.

00:15:55.014 --> 00:15:56.613
That's Dougal MacKenzie.

00:15:56.649 --> 00:15:57.881
Personal friend of mine.

00:15:57.917 --> 00:16:00.284
You are?

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:04.121
I'm your prince, Charles Edward Stuart.

00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:07.224
Are ye really?

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:09.226
Ye hear that?

00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:11.962
I'm talking to the prince.

00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:13.330
An honor to make yer acquaintance,

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:15.332
- Your Royal Highness.
- Quite so.

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:25.843
Easy, boy.

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:33.350
Fire at will!

00:16:49.068 --> 00:16:51.201
- Fire!
- Come on.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.276
Ease off, lads.

00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:25.202
I think we've learned
all we need to know.

00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:27.938
Quite enough.

00:18:06.011 --> 00:18:08.011
Surrender.

00:18:14.086 --> 00:18:17.220
Bravo! Bravo!

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:32.035
Mark me, if I had 100 men like you,

00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:34.671
this war would be over tomorrow.

00:18:34.707 --> 00:18:37.040
Well, I dinna ken about
that, Your Royal Highness,

00:18:37.076 --> 00:18:39.276
but I fear that it's joyless news

00:18:39.311 --> 00:18:41.011
that I bring back with me.

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:43.013
Indeed.

00:18:43.048 --> 00:18:45.215
Gentlemen,

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.318
there will be no
glorious Highland charge

00:18:48.354 --> 00:18:49.820
through Tranent Meadows.

00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:52.990
Damn me, we can't get to the British,

00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:54.524
and they can't get to us.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.226
We should
disengage from the enemy

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.728
under cover of darkness

00:18:57.763 --> 00:18:59.629
and return to Edinburgh.

00:18:59.665 --> 00:19:03.300
And wait for the British
to lay siege to the city?

00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:06.269
The enemy is here,
General, not in Edinburgh.

00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:14.044
Now, I look to you to
break this stalemate

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:17.214
or I will be forced to
find myself a new general.

00:19:26.825 --> 00:19:30.861
Ye're a lucky bastard.

00:19:30.896 --> 00:19:32.996
Ye should get that looked at.

00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:34.231
Either way.

00:19:34.266 --> 00:19:36.900
It's just a scratch.

00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:39.736
And now, I'm off to change my breeks

00:19:39.772 --> 00:19:42.572
because the hero of the
hour has shat his pants.

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:56.887
So, apparently your Doctor MacPherson

00:19:56.922 --> 00:19:58.955
left Tranent a few days ago.

00:19:58.991 --> 00:20:01.725
But fortunately, he left
his medical bag behind.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.061
The instruments in it will prove useful,

00:20:04.096 --> 00:20:07.397
more useful than the doctor
himself probably would have.

00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:10.700
So, it is up to us to
tend to the wounded.

00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:12.069
And I have no doubt that together

00:20:12.104 --> 00:20:14.104
we will be able to do it.

00:20:16.175 --> 00:20:18.842
Molly Cockburn, you're a strong girl.

00:20:18.877 --> 00:20:21.178
Now, your job is to see to it
that the pails and buckets

00:20:21.213 --> 00:20:23.113
are filled at all times.

00:20:23.148 --> 00:20:24.981
And use water from the well only.

00:20:25.017 --> 00:20:26.516
Yes, Lady Broch Tuarach.

00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:27.884
There's no time for all of that.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.220
"Claire" is fine.

00:20:32.024 --> 00:20:34.458
Fergus?

00:20:34.493 --> 00:20:35.959
Please?

00:20:35.994 --> 00:20:38.061
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:40.197
Alice McMurdo, Madame.

00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:41.998
Alice, that's right.

00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:44.401
You are responsible for looking
after the honey water.

00:20:44.436 --> 00:20:46.169
Begging your pardon,

00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.371
I don't see what good
sweet water's going to do

00:20:48.407 --> 00:20:49.506
for bullet wounds.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.643
Well, for the wounds
themselves, nothing.

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:56.947
But it will help keep the
patients' blood pressure up.

00:20:56.982 --> 00:20:59.649
Trust me, it's important.

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:02.619
It will also help
replace any fluids lost

00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:04.187
and prevent shock.

00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:10.227
And our friend Fergus here,
he will be responsible

00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:12.362
for keeping the kettle fires burning.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:13.864
Women's work.

00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:16.199
I-I'm sorry. What was that?

00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:18.068
Nothing, Milady.

00:21:18.103 --> 00:21:19.536
Leave it to me.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.004
Thank you.

00:21:29.982 --> 00:21:32.215
Milady! Milady!

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:33.984
This gentleman, he wishes to speak

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:35.819
to the commander of His Highness' army.

00:21:35.854 --> 00:21:38.455
Has information of the
utmost importance.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.690
Allina, Alice, a moment please.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:43.860
Sir.

00:21:43.896 --> 00:21:46.029
I'm Richard Anderson
of Whitburgh, Madame.

00:21:46.064 --> 00:21:48.064
Lady Broch Tuarach, Claire Fraser.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.699
Yes, Milady.

00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:51.701
Ye see, I've lived in
these parts all my life.

00:21:51.737 --> 00:21:53.904
My father owns the land,
so I ken the grounds

00:21:53.939 --> 00:21:58.041
where the armies are like
the back of my hand.

00:21:58.076 --> 00:21:59.843
There's a way down from the ridge

00:21:59.878 --> 00:22:02.045
where the Highland troops are.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.513
A small, hidden trail
that will lead them

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:04.881
past the bog at the bottom

00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:08.718
to catch the English unawares.

00:22:08.754 --> 00:22:10.153
- I see.
- If I may speak

00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:13.557
to a commander, perhaps
Lord Murray himself.

00:22:16.728 --> 00:22:19.162
Fergus, do you think you
can find your master?

00:22:19.198 --> 00:22:20.530
Yes, I-I will find him.

00:22:20.566 --> 00:22:22.032
Go now, but be careful.

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:23.366
Tell him to come back straightaway

00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:25.101
to speak with Mr. Anderson.

00:22:28.607 --> 00:22:30.173
Here, you say?

00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:32.943
Aye. Or thereabouts.

00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:34.477
I don't ken much from maps.

00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:36.046
There's no such path marked.

00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:37.948
Marked or no, it's there.

00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:40.817
As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's
a narrow, winding path,

00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:42.052
hard to spot in daylight,

00:22:42.087 --> 00:22:43.987
and hopeless to find in the dark.

00:22:44.022 --> 00:22:45.388
Unless ye ken where to look.

00:22:45.424 --> 00:22:48.491
And you do?

00:22:48.527 --> 00:22:50.527
Aye, I do.

00:22:53.198 --> 00:22:56.833
Fortune drops out of the
sky and onto our doorstep.

00:22:56.868 --> 00:22:58.168
Convenient, is it not?

00:22:58.203 --> 00:23:00.203
If we dare trust this boy.

00:23:03.075 --> 00:23:06.843
And ye're willing to lead
us across the meadows?

00:23:06.878 --> 00:23:08.612
There's no other way for it.

00:23:08.647 --> 00:23:10.046
I'm no much for fighting,

00:23:10.082 --> 00:23:10.947
but I'll get ye from here to there

00:23:10.983 --> 00:23:14.718
without a misstep.

00:23:14.753 --> 00:23:16.853
Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

00:23:16.888 --> 00:23:18.822
Your help is much appreciated.

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:20.857
I do wish that John was here.

00:23:20.892 --> 00:23:22.859
I pray I might hear his opinion.

00:23:22.894 --> 00:23:25.462
And I pray the Quartermaster
is off somewhere

00:23:25.497 --> 00:23:27.831
gathering much needed
victuals for this army.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:30.600
Delay could prove fatal,
Your Royal Highness.

00:23:43.382 --> 00:23:44.981
Off we go, gentlemen.

00:23:45.017 --> 00:23:46.283
Now we shall not return

00:23:46.318 --> 00:23:48.385
unless we bring victory back with us.

00:23:52.924 --> 00:23:54.691
I'm not saying it's going to happen,

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:57.060
but if it does, if I'm
to fall in battle,

00:23:57.095 --> 00:23:58.828
it would ease me greatly to know

00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:01.031
that you'll watch over
Bess and the croft.

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.032
And I'll do the same for you,

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.400
if it proves necessary.

00:24:03.435 --> 00:24:06.736
My Marina and the six bairns?

00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:11.074
I'd wish them on no man.

00:24:11.109 --> 00:24:13.677
Listen, there's a wee bit of coin

00:24:13.712 --> 00:24:14.878
buried south of the pig sty.

00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:17.380
She-devil knows where.

00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:19.382
- Then it's settled.
- Aye.

00:24:19.418 --> 00:24:22.018
What's mine is yours, and yours mine.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.134
You can have my sword.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.402
And my dirk.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.873
And my sporran.

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:45.842
And all that it contains, eh?

00:24:45.877 --> 00:24:47.877
What are you havering about now?

00:24:47.913 --> 00:24:50.547
Were ye no listening to those two?

00:24:50.582 --> 00:24:53.883
What's his is his.

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:57.620
What's mine is yours.

00:24:57.656 --> 00:24:59.055
What use would I have for a sword

00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:01.057
that's never been used?

00:25:01.093 --> 00:25:02.525
Ye think I need a fat man's blade

00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:03.993
dangling from my hip?

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:06.029
Eh?

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:10.533
It occurs to me...

00:25:10.569 --> 00:25:14.738
I'll be leaving Scarlet to ye as well.

00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:17.540
Scarlet the whore?

00:25:17.576 --> 00:25:19.709
Part-time whore.

00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:20.877
Full-time barmaid.

00:25:20.912 --> 00:25:23.680
She's not yours to
give, ye daft bastard.

00:25:23.715 --> 00:25:25.181
Well, I'm saying she is.

00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.686
And it's ye I'll be giving her to.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.190
Do ye accept?

00:25:36.228 --> 00:25:38.061
I do not.

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:39.662
Now shut yer gab

00:25:39.698 --> 00:25:43.266
before ye bring the
devil's own eye upon us.

00:25:47.205 --> 00:25:50.039
If ye dinna put that whetstone down,

00:25:50.075 --> 00:25:52.475
ye'll be grinding that
blade to a needle.

00:25:58.517 --> 00:26:00.583
May as well get it off yer chest.

00:26:02.854 --> 00:26:05.889
Whatever it is.

00:26:05.924 --> 00:26:08.558
Ah...

00:26:08.593 --> 00:26:10.593
It's just...

00:26:13.064 --> 00:26:18.134
In a raid, every man has a part to play.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.972
You tell yerself that the
raid's success or failure

00:26:23.008 --> 00:26:26.943
is dependent on yer actions.

00:26:26.978 --> 00:26:29.279
And if ye're forced to wound a man,

00:26:29.314 --> 00:26:31.381
kill him even,

00:26:31.416 --> 00:26:33.483
chances are...

00:26:33.518 --> 00:26:36.219
ye stare into his eyes when doing it.

00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:43.726
And if you were to be killed,

00:26:43.762 --> 00:26:46.129
ye'd die knowing that yer memory

00:26:46.164 --> 00:26:50.333
would live on within yer clan.

00:26:50.368 --> 00:26:54.337
Yer death would have meaning.

00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:57.474
But this...

00:26:57.509 --> 00:26:59.275
this is different.

00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:03.279
We're but part of a 2,000 strong army.

00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:06.683
My death, your death, alone
would be meaningless.

00:27:06.718 --> 00:27:10.220
500, 1,000 would have to be slain

00:27:10.255 --> 00:27:14.791
before our deaths take on any meaning.

00:27:14.826 --> 00:27:18.061
That's not a very comforting
thought on the eve of battle.

00:27:20.432 --> 00:27:23.333
Aye.

00:27:23.368 --> 00:27:25.268
It weighs on me.

00:27:27.506 --> 00:27:29.205
If it's words of comfort
ye're looking for,

00:27:29.241 --> 00:27:31.241
I've none to give.

00:27:36.147 --> 00:27:38.815
In Paris,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.850
I almost lost my marriage

00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:43.553
trying to stop all of
this from happening.

00:27:48.727 --> 00:27:50.293
I failed.

00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:52.328
We.

00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:54.364
We failed.

00:28:00.105 --> 00:28:02.405
If there's any solace,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.207
I feel much the same way you do.

00:28:04.242 --> 00:28:06.543
Aye.

00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:08.344
It is.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.395
Make sure you get some sleep, Sassenach.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.665
Tomorrow will be a... a
trying day for us all.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.835
I don't think sleep will be
an option for anyone tonight.

00:28:32.871 --> 00:28:35.305
Milady, Milord.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.207
I request permission to join you
in the fight that is to come.

00:28:38.243 --> 00:28:41.010
And who will keep the
hospital fires burning, hmm?

00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:44.147
I'm sure someone else
can handle such work.

00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:47.050
I can sneak into the very
tent of General Cope.

00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:48.351
I will steal his sword.

00:28:48.386 --> 00:28:51.387
A general cannot fight
without his sword.

00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:53.656
I don't doubt yer capabilities, laddie.

00:28:53.692 --> 00:28:57.060
But without you, who will
look after the women?

00:28:57.095 --> 00:28:58.995
Uh, the... the same person
who keeps the fires lit,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.396
I don't know.

00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:05.034
Mm. And what of our Lady
Broch Tuarach, huh?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.071
There's no one I trust with
her safety more than you.

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:10.139
Looks like you're going to have to stay

00:29:10.175 --> 00:29:13.676
and like it. Is that understood?

00:29:13.712 --> 00:29:15.511
Jamie.

00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:17.113
It's time.

00:29:17.148 --> 00:29:19.983
It's time to send the
British army to hell.

00:29:20.018 --> 00:29:22.118
If you ask me,

00:29:22.153 --> 00:29:26.723
the British don't stand a chance.

00:29:26.758 --> 00:29:28.891
Angus.

00:29:28.927 --> 00:29:31.127
Surely there's another woman you
can have kiss you good-bye.

00:29:31.162 --> 00:29:32.495
Oh, none that will have him.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.030
Must I remind you, Mistress,

00:29:34.065 --> 00:29:35.865
at this time tomorrow

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.001
I could be laying in a
field bleeding to death?

00:29:38.036 --> 00:29:40.670
I would hate for my last thought to be

00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:43.906
how you denied me my final request.

00:29:47.178 --> 00:29:49.812
You are shameless.

00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:54.951
I'll not say good-bye to ye, Claire.

00:29:54.986 --> 00:29:56.853
No need to, since none of us

00:29:56.888 --> 00:30:00.056
will be meeting our maker in this place.

00:30:00.091 --> 00:30:03.559
When we meet again, it'll
be to embrace in victory,

00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:05.928
share a stiff dram.

00:30:07.198 --> 00:30:09.165
Mistress.

00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.311
Watch over Jamie.

00:30:22.347 --> 00:30:24.947
Always.

00:30:24.983 --> 00:30:28.618
We will win the day, correct?

00:30:28.653 --> 00:30:33.122
It is the promise of history.

00:30:33.158 --> 00:30:37.794
Yes, we will win this day.

00:30:37.829 --> 00:30:39.629
So we shall.

00:31:11.596 --> 00:31:13.162
On your way, soldier.

00:32:16.528 --> 00:32:18.761
Get some rest, all of you.

00:32:18.797 --> 00:32:20.797
That's an order.

00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:31.307
Have any of you seen Fergus?

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:50.960
I'll be leaving you now if it's
all the same to you, General.

00:32:50.995 --> 00:32:52.628
I'm no general,

00:32:52.664 --> 00:32:54.897
but all of Scotland's in your debt.

00:32:57.702 --> 00:32:59.502
General Murray,

00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:02.305
you see the prince stays
here out of harm's way.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.340
I shall indeed.

00:33:04.375 --> 00:33:05.908
Gentlemen,

00:33:05.944 --> 00:33:09.946
must I remind you that this is my army?

00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:12.248
Now I very much desire to
lead them into battle.

00:33:12.283 --> 00:33:14.483
It is my right and my destiny.

00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:16.118
I carry a sword,

00:33:16.154 --> 00:33:17.987
and I am trained in its use.

00:33:18.022 --> 00:33:20.756
I dinna doubt it, but Your
Royal Highness must realize

00:33:20.792 --> 00:33:22.959
this rebellion would never
survive your death.

00:33:22.994 --> 00:33:25.494
Besides, regaining the throne
would never mean as much

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.297
to King James if the son
that made it possible

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:29.933
wasna there to share the moment wi' him.

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:36.539
A touching sentiment, James.

00:33:36.574 --> 00:33:38.307
Mark me,

00:33:38.343 --> 00:33:42.745
I don't believe my father
is all that fond of me.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.580
Nevertheless,

00:33:44.616 --> 00:33:45.948
ye shall remain behind the lines

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:48.784
with the Quartermaster
and the Lord General.

00:33:57.729 --> 00:33:59.795
I need these strips
to be a little wider.

00:33:59.831 --> 00:34:00.831
Yes, Madame.

00:34:05.203 --> 00:34:06.535
That looks good.

00:34:06.571 --> 00:34:07.571
Just keep going.

00:34:13.278 --> 00:34:16.946
I know what you're all feeling.

00:34:20.885 --> 00:34:22.885
I've been there myself.

00:34:26.024 --> 00:34:29.325
The fear. The self-doubt.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.995
But our men are depending on us.

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:35.097
And we will not let them down.

00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:54.016
Boil these again. They
need to be spotless.

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:56.052
Right away.

00:36:00.651 --> 00:36:04.286
Everyone up! Get up!

00:36:17.168 --> 00:36:20.202
"He that dwelleth in the
secret place of the most High

00:36:20.238 --> 00:36:23.005
"shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty.

00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:25.508
- I will say of the Lord..."
- Go get more firewood, please.

00:36:25.543 --> 00:36:28.611
We're going to need lots
and lots of hot water.

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:33.449
<i>"He is my refuge and
my fortress: my God:</i>

00:36:33.484 --> 00:36:34.984
<i>in Him will I trust."</i>

00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:19.295
I'm sorry, lad, ye'll
have to bite it tight.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.530
Ross?

00:37:21.566 --> 00:37:23.866
Come with me.

00:37:25.203 --> 00:37:27.036
<i>Could someone get some more hot water?</i>

00:37:28.906 --> 00:37:30.940
<i>More dressings!</i>

00:37:32.477 --> 00:37:34.877
<i>If ye could rip more dressings!</i>

00:37:37.782 --> 00:37:39.782
I'm sorry.

00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:43.219
Sorry?

00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:49.692
He's gone.

00:37:49.727 --> 00:37:51.727
Claire.

00:37:56.534 --> 00:38:00.436
There's nothing more I can do.

00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:35.304
Come on!

00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:50.419
Stand your ground, you dogs!

00:38:50.454 --> 00:38:54.423
Don't turn your back on these traitors!

00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:56.959
Stand your ground!

00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:14.643
The British! The British
prisoners are here.

00:39:17.648 --> 00:39:19.682
We mean you no harm, Madame.

00:39:19.717 --> 00:39:22.084
But we do require your assistance.

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:25.254
Allina, sort these men out by
the severity of their wounds.

00:39:25.289 --> 00:39:29.792
- Come with me.
- You two, over there.

00:39:29.827 --> 00:39:30.960
Get this man on to a bed.

00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:33.362
Rupert, he needs you, Mistress.

00:39:33.397 --> 00:39:35.864
Rupert, I'll be there in a second.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.435
Now!

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.004
- Allina, take over here.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:39:43.874 --> 00:39:46.976
Ye must save him, Mistress.

00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:48.877
I'll no allow that fat
bawbag to die on me.

00:39:53.618 --> 00:39:55.951
Oh.

00:39:55.987 --> 00:39:58.153
Molly, we have to close this wound

00:39:58.189 --> 00:39:59.822
before an infection sets in.

00:39:59.857 --> 00:40:01.590
Get me hot water, a large
needle, and thread.

00:40:01.626 --> 00:40:02.992
- Now!
- Right away, mistress.

00:40:03.027 --> 00:40:07.997
Angus, it was Angus. Is he blown up?

00:40:08.032 --> 00:40:09.865
Tell me!

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.834
- What's he talking about?
- It's just a cannon blast.

00:40:11.869 --> 00:40:13.869
It's nothing.

00:40:15.873 --> 00:40:17.840
<i>Damn it all!</i>

00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:19.975
<i>Stand your ground!</i>

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.636
Tell me true, Mistress,

00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:22.671
will he live?

00:41:24.842 --> 00:41:27.343
I wish I knew.

00:41:27.378 --> 00:41:29.078
But he's strong,

00:41:29.113 --> 00:41:32.915
and if the wound doesn't fester, then...

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:35.851
Let me see that head of yours.

00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:37.686
Come on.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.160
Your eyes are clear. Any nausea?

00:41:45.196 --> 00:41:47.629
No. I told ye, I'm fine.

00:41:47.665 --> 00:41:49.965
If it's anything, it's
a mild concussion.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
So you can stay here by Rupert,

00:41:52.036 --> 00:41:53.869
but no napping; I want you awake.

00:41:53.904 --> 00:41:56.372
Well, I must admit,

00:41:56.407 --> 00:41:59.775
I'm bone-weary,

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.645
but I'll be keeping both
eyes on this big belly

00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:05.814
going up and down.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.817
Well, as long as it does, there's hope.

00:42:08.853 --> 00:42:10.853
Aye.

00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:22.197
The day is ours, Sassenach.

00:42:22.233 --> 00:42:23.999
The British are routed.

00:42:24.034 --> 00:42:25.868
General Cope is in retreat,

00:42:25.903 --> 00:42:27.803
leaving hundreds of dead
and wounded behind.

00:42:31.008 --> 00:42:35.177
And our losses can't
number more than 50 men.

00:42:35.212 --> 00:42:37.813
The whole thing took all of 15 minutes.

00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:40.182
If only we had cavalry, huh,

00:42:40.217 --> 00:42:41.950
we could have pursued the
enemy, captured General Cope,

00:42:41.986 --> 00:42:43.452
perhaps put an end to the rebellion

00:42:43.487 --> 00:42:44.586
this very morning.

00:42:59.036 --> 00:43:00.836
Where's Fergus?

00:43:00.871 --> 00:43:02.104
I'm sure he went to fight.

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:03.839
Dinna fash, Sassenach.

00:43:03.874 --> 00:43:05.841
Take a wee peek outside.

00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:15.918
Fergus!

00:43:15.953 --> 00:43:17.252
Oh, you wretch!

00:43:17.288 --> 00:43:20.489
What do you mean by
sneaking off like that?

00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:24.493
Should box your ears
until your head rattles.

00:43:24.528 --> 00:43:28.030
- Milady.
- Are you all right?

00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:31.033
I...

00:43:31.068 --> 00:43:35.337
I-I killed an English soldier, Milady.

00:43:35.372 --> 00:43:37.639
Don't tell me that.

00:43:37.675 --> 00:43:39.641
I think I killed him.

00:43:41.879 --> 00:43:45.080
He... he fell down.

00:43:45.115 --> 00:43:47.950
I had a knife.

00:43:47.985 --> 00:43:49.485
I struck him.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.589
Oh, God, Fergus.

00:43:53.624 --> 00:43:56.925
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:43:56.961 --> 00:43:58.360
You aren't injured, are you?

00:43:58.395 --> 00:44:00.395
No.

00:44:02.066 --> 00:44:04.800
I'm just...

00:44:04.835 --> 00:44:06.668
tired.

00:44:06.704 --> 00:44:09.671
Very, very tired.

00:44:15.713 --> 00:44:17.913
Come with me.

00:44:17.948 --> 00:44:19.081
I'll get you some food,

00:44:19.116 --> 00:44:20.816
somewhere to sleep.

00:44:30.961 --> 00:44:34.329
Ahh!

00:44:47.978 --> 00:44:49.978
Dougal MacKenzie.

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:54.850
Do I know ye?

00:44:54.885 --> 00:44:56.652
Lieutenant Jeremy Foster.

00:44:56.687 --> 00:44:58.487
I accompanied you and the
lady Claire Beauchamp

00:44:58.522 --> 00:45:00.422
to the village of Brockton.

00:45:00.457 --> 00:45:02.691
Oh, aye.

00:45:02.726 --> 00:45:05.827
The only honorable redcoat

00:45:05.863 --> 00:45:08.830
in Lord Thomas' staff.

00:45:08.866 --> 00:45:11.433
I would be much obliged if you
would see me to your infirmary.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.704
Oh, ye expect me to carry ye to Tranent?

00:45:15.739 --> 00:45:17.973
I've still got work to do here.

00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:20.475
Is your thirst for slaughter
not quenched yet?

00:45:20.511 --> 00:45:22.077
You've won a great victory today.

00:45:22.112 --> 00:45:23.812
Aye.

00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:26.214
And I wager there'll be
many more to follow.

00:45:30.054 --> 00:45:32.621
A war chief should know better.

00:45:32.656 --> 00:45:34.923
I tell you this in all candor:

00:45:34.959 --> 00:45:37.659
you cannot defeat the British army.

00:45:37.695 --> 00:45:41.330
You've won a battle, but you
will never win this war.

00:45:50.975 --> 00:45:52.941
Well...

00:45:57.615 --> 00:45:59.247
No. No!

00:45:59.283 --> 00:46:01.350
God alone knows the answer to that.

00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:06.788
Shush.

00:46:06.824 --> 00:46:07.824
There, there.

00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:14.329
And if so...

00:46:14.365 --> 00:46:16.498
I'll look for you in hell.

00:46:48.532 --> 00:46:50.532
We did not run.

00:47:02.446 --> 00:47:04.946
Dinna fash yerself,

00:47:04.982 --> 00:47:07.015
that blubber no doubt
protected his innards.

00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:08.950
Aye.

00:47:08.986 --> 00:47:11.787
Must have been those third
portions he gobbled that did it.

00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:15.791
Aye, the man could eat.

00:47:18.862 --> 00:47:21.863
Can eat, I meant to say.

00:47:23.667 --> 00:47:26.134
Easy now, ally,

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.769
you look done in.

00:47:27.805 --> 00:47:28.970
No, it's just...

00:47:29.006 --> 00:47:31.073
It's been a long night.

00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:45.087
What is that?

00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:47.089
You look like you got
stepped on by a horse.

00:47:47.124 --> 00:47:50.258
Hm, 'cause I was.

00:47:50.294 --> 00:47:53.028
The British were in such retreat

00:47:53.063 --> 00:47:54.996
an officer galloped right over me.

00:47:59.703 --> 00:48:01.870
Here, fill this.

00:48:01.905 --> 00:48:04.973
You've had 400 weight of
horse step on your kidney.

00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:06.928
I want to see if there's
any blood in your urine.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.102
Here.

00:48:34.138 --> 00:48:37.339
Hold this while I take aim.

00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:40.675
Six pence says you can't make it

00:48:40.711 --> 00:48:42.944
from where you stand.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.915
Ah, I wouldna say it was
easy, but for six pence,

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.250
ow, I'll make the effort.

00:48:48.285 --> 00:48:49.785
Silence, everyone.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.720
Let the man concentrate.

00:49:01.565 --> 00:49:03.865
Madame Fraser,

00:49:03.901 --> 00:49:08.136
your labors on our behalf
are much appreciated.

00:49:08.172 --> 00:49:10.939
Your Royal Highness.

00:49:10.974 --> 00:49:13.942
Please be careful of the
blood; the floor is slippery.

00:49:21.018 --> 00:49:24.986
I bring you the blessing and
gratitude of my father.

00:49:25.022 --> 00:49:29.624
Your deeds today will
be forever remembered.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.828
If this victory had been
obtained over foreigners,

00:49:32.863 --> 00:49:34.496
my joy would be complete.

00:49:34.531 --> 00:49:37.199
But as it is over Englishmen,

00:49:37.234 --> 00:49:40.569
it brings a damp chill over my heart.

00:49:42.239 --> 00:49:45.173
I say to you all:

00:49:45.209 --> 00:49:48.143
I came here in the interests
of both our countries,

00:49:48.178 --> 00:49:49.911
which are, in truth,

00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:53.315
but one country.

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.918
- My father will tell me...
- Victory is ours!

00:49:56.954 --> 00:49:59.521
Let the writing of the ballads begin.

00:49:59.556 --> 00:50:01.957
Dougal!

00:50:01.992 --> 00:50:04.326
What's this, then? What?

00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:06.528
Do ye mean to tell me ye
been tending this scum

00:50:06.563 --> 00:50:08.029
as if they were yer own kin?

00:50:08.065 --> 00:50:09.831
Dougal, the British were taught

00:50:09.867 --> 00:50:11.466
a lesson this morning they
are not soon to forget.

00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:13.001
Like bloody hell.

00:50:13.036 --> 00:50:14.336
I say we put an end to this shit here...

00:50:14.371 --> 00:50:16.271
No, killing these men
willna add to our victory.

00:50:16.306 --> 00:50:17.973
Ye call these bastards "men"?

00:50:18.008 --> 00:50:20.308
Yes.

00:50:20.344 --> 00:50:22.911
Men.

00:50:22.946 --> 00:50:25.113
And they are my father's subjects.

00:50:30.487 --> 00:50:32.020
And each one of them

00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:34.055
is your brother.

00:50:36.627 --> 00:50:40.862
My God, sir, where is
your Christian charity?

00:50:40.898 --> 00:50:42.664
James...

00:50:42.699 --> 00:50:44.466
I wish for you to remove this gentleman

00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:46.034
from the muster roll immediately.

00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:49.170
There is no place for
such wanton disregard

00:50:49.206 --> 00:50:51.206
for Englishmen in my army.

00:51:05.322 --> 00:51:08.123
Dougal MacKenzie is a true warrior.

00:51:08.158 --> 00:51:11.293
Your Royal Highness, I ken it well,

00:51:11.328 --> 00:51:14.963
despite his foolish tongue.

00:51:21.872 --> 00:51:24.005
If this army is to triumph,

00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.840
we'll need every warrior we can muster.

00:51:25.876 --> 00:51:28.009
Yes, James.

00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:32.347
And the fastest horse will
undoubtedly win the race.

00:51:32.382 --> 00:51:33.915
Now what good is it

00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:37.285
when its master is tossed from
its saddle in the process?

00:51:37.321 --> 00:51:40.288
What am I to do with such a
blood-thirsty barbarian?

00:51:40.324 --> 00:51:43.325
We... promote him...

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.596
Your Royal Highness.

00:51:48.632 --> 00:51:52.701
As captain of the newly formed

00:51:52.736 --> 00:51:54.936
Highlander Dragoons,

00:51:54.972 --> 00:51:57.872
give him 15

00:51:57.908 --> 00:52:00.141
of our best riders and horses.

00:52:00.177 --> 00:52:02.911
Let them follow the enemy,

00:52:02.946 --> 00:52:05.313
report on troop movements,

00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:06.915
harass his supply lines.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.551
That way, we use his abilities...

00:52:12.889 --> 00:52:15.957
and Your Royal Highness will
never have to lay eyes upon him.

00:52:22.232 --> 00:52:25.233
You have an ingenious mind, James.

00:52:34.444 --> 00:52:37.612
You are in his debt, rouge.

00:52:37.647 --> 00:52:40.615
See that he does not come
to lament his benevolence.

00:52:58.068 --> 00:52:59.934
I thank you, lad.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.370
Truly.

00:53:02.406 --> 00:53:04.272
And I swear...

00:53:04.307 --> 00:53:07.776
that I will not give you cause
to regret your generosity.

00:53:09.679 --> 00:53:11.112
But I know what ye're up to.

00:53:14.217 --> 00:53:17.085
Ye champion me and ye exile me,

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.587
both at the same time.

00:53:19.623 --> 00:53:22.490
That's a plan worthy
of my brother Colum.

00:53:28.632 --> 00:53:31.099
Angus, how's Rupert?

00:53:32.903 --> 00:53:36.204
Talk to me, man. He's my friend as well.

00:53:36.239 --> 00:53:38.006
Claire!

00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:39.174
Angus!

00:53:44.114 --> 00:53:46.414
Oh, my God, the cannon blast.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.484
He's been bleeding
internally this whole time.

00:53:49.519 --> 00:53:51.186
- Angus.
- Is there nothing you can do?

00:56:27.978 --> 00:56:32.447
I expected the flavor of
victory to taste sweeter.

00:56:32.482 --> 00:56:35.516
Aye. War tastes bitter,
no matter the outcome.

00:56:38.521 --> 00:56:41.923
Well, Claire,

00:56:41.958 --> 00:56:46.527
turns out you were right
about Prestonpans after all.

00:56:46.563 --> 00:56:48.563
I was, wasn't I?

00:56:53.203 --> 00:56:55.670
That means I'm also right

00:56:55.705 --> 00:56:58.406
about the disaster
awaiting us at Culloden.
