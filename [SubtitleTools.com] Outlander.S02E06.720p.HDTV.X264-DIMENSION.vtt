00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:06.798
<i>Previously...</i>

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.995
What if I were to tell you

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.924
we were about to come into possession

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.502
of £10,000 from Comte St. Germain?

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:14.277
<i>He wishes to buy a large shipment</i>

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:15.561
<i>of Portuguese Madeira?</i>

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:17.313
We make it appear as though smallpox

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.065
is present in St. Germain's crew.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:20.199
Convince everyone the shipment's tainted

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:21.651
and have it destroyed.

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:23.152
<i>When Monsieur Forez serves</i>

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.722
as His Majesty's royal executioner.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.951
It's a peculiar calling.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:28.452
Follow me. The king is not enamored

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:29.837
of the mystical art.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.456
We must be wary not to invoke his ire.

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:34.925
Jack Randall is alive.
What just happened?

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.128
I challenged him to a
duel and he accepted.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.796
You can't kill Randall.

00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:40.518
It would be as if you're
killing Frank, too.

00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:43.127
Now you have your choice. Him or me.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:45.296
One year. After that, I swear,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:47.165
I will help you bleed him myself.

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:50.168
A year. Not one day more.

_

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:36.574
Randall's been
released from the Bastille.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.526
I'll meet with his
second this afternoon,

00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:40.695
set the terms for the duel.

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:44.749
Two days from now at dawn. Hmm?

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:46.417
Dinna fash, lad.

00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:48.119
Magnus assures me that the...

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:50.171
the woods west of the city are safe.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:52.623
<i>Gens d'armes</i> dinna patrol there.

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:56.461
Lad?

00:02:56.463 --> 00:02:58.346
Aye.

00:02:59.632 --> 00:03:02.266
You need to concentrate.

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:03.801
I'll fetch the broadswords.

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.803
We'll meet in the courtyard,

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:07.772
hone your skills.

00:03:07.807 --> 00:03:10.475
I can't.

00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:11.726
Well, before supper then.

00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:14.111
Rather not wait till tomorrow.

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:17.315
Ye need to work that bad hand.

00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:19.367
I'm not dueling with Randall.

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:28.159
I've already sent word,

00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.078
withdrawing the challenge.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.414
What?

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:35.466
Why?

00:03:38.338 --> 00:03:39.637
Why?

00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:41.806
Well, uh, it's ower-complicated.

00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:43.257
I ken I'm a simple man,

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.842
but strive for an explanation.

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:46.310
I canna, Murtagh.

00:03:46.346 --> 00:03:49.146
Ye canna?

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:52.350
Yer mind changes like a woman in flux.

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:57.605
Trust I've a sound reason.

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:06.614
- Good morning, master Murtagh.
- Says you.

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:08.749
_

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:12.837
Milady has instructed that
you have a proper meal

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:15.706
to start your day.

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:17.508
Where is Milady this morning?

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:20.545
She has gone to<i> L'Hôpital.</i>

00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:23.381
- Of course she has.
- Pardon?

00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:25.850
Nothing.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:27.552
Merci, Magnus.

00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:45.820
Madame Fraser,

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:47.788
I wonder if you would be so kind

00:04:47.824 --> 00:04:50.408
as to help me prepare
this man for burial?

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.243
Certainly.

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:54.245
You're going somewhere?

00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:55.880
I've been summoned by His Majesty

00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:59.300
to perform my usual duties.

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.470
Ah, your usual duties.

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:05.556
What crime is this man
being executed for?

00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:08.559
It is said to be several persons.

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:13.564
Practitioners of the dark arts.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.984
And all those who associate with them.

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:23.774
When is this to happen?

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:26.527
Once they are gathered, I suppose.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:29.864
I thought perhaps they should be hanged.

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:31.282
But the king's pleasure

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.784
is to have them drawn and quartered,

00:05:33.786 --> 00:05:37.254
so I must be at the ready, hmm?

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.007
Pleasure is not the word
that comes to mind.

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:46.964
Make no mistake, Madame Fraser,

00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:49.634
to choke a man to death
at the end of a rope,

00:05:49.686 --> 00:05:52.803
anyone can do this.

00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:54.889
But to properly execute the sentence

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:57.391
of drawing and quartering,

00:05:57.443 --> 00:06:01.445
that requires great skill indeed.

00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:04.982
I imagine so.

00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:06.484
First,

00:06:06.536 --> 00:06:10.621
the man or woman...

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.990
must be hanged,

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:17.495
but with judgment, so that
the neck is not broken.

00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:24.001
As death approaches, you
must reach inside the cavity

00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:28.506
and grasp the heart, hmm.

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:30.758
The main difficulty lies in severing

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.844
the large vessels above quickly,

00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:38.432
so that the organ may be pulled forth

00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:42.403
while still beating, hmm.

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:44.605
Hm.

00:06:44.657 --> 00:06:47.658
You wish to please the crowd, hmm.

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:56.333
As for the rest, ah,

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:58.452
mere butchery.

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:01.872
Once life is extinct,

00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:04.041
there is no further need for skill.

00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:10.181
No, I suppose not.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.853
I have made you pale

00:07:15.888 --> 00:07:18.889
with this tedious conversation.

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.729
Perhaps our friend Master Raymond

00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:26.480
would be better company.

00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:38.542
<i>Au revoir,</i> Madame Fraser.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.972
Can you spare, Madame?

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:03.017
You need to leave the city at once.

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:04.819
The king is on a crusade to root out

00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:06.937
practitioners of the
black arts from Paris.

00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:09.657
Yes, yes. This has happened before.

00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:12.693
It is of no concern.

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:16.781
King Louis'
great-grandfather, Louis XIV,

00:08:16.783 --> 00:08:19.583
did much the same decades ago.

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:21.786
Plucking heretics from the city

00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:24.505
as one might remove
weeds from the garden.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.458
'Twas a veiled manifestation

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.794
of his piousness.

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:32.463
Soon afterwards they were all freed,

00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:36.801
a mere renunciation of Satan as penance.

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:39.019
I fear this time is different.

00:08:39.055 --> 00:08:40.971
I think the king is out for actual blood

00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:42.523
rather than Hail Marys.

00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:44.108
Monsieur Forez confided to me

00:08:44.143 --> 00:08:46.861
that he's preparing for
multiple executions.

00:08:46.896 --> 00:08:49.697
You're in danger, Master Raymond.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.988
Well...

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.959
if it is as you say,

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:03.210
you shouldn't have come here.

00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:06.630
You've put yourself at grave risk.

00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:08.499
But, um,

00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.752
I'm touched by your
concern for my welfare.

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:14.255
This is what friends do for one another.

00:09:14.307 --> 00:09:15.840
<i>Merci, amie,</i>

00:09:15.842 --> 00:09:19.510
I will heed your warning
and flee the city at once.

00:09:19.512 --> 00:09:22.680
Don't worry, no matter how
often one removes weeds,

00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:25.015
they have a habit of reappearing.

00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:27.268
We will meet again, Madonna...

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.019
in this life or another.

00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:31.906
I certainly hope so.

00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:33.908
Please, be careful.

00:09:54.297 --> 00:09:59.016
Mm, how did you know that's
exactly what I needed right now?

00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:00.718
Hmm.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.219
I remember how much Jenny said it helped

00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.271
when she was with child.

00:10:13.983 --> 00:10:16.617
I've been thinking that...

00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:18.953
remember you said I owed you a life,

00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:21.071
because you saved mine?

00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:25.960
Well, I've saved yours as
well, at least as often.

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:29.246
Seems to me we're even.

00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:31.749
"Even"?

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.001
Aye.

00:10:34.053 --> 00:10:37.922
I dinna give you Randall's
life in payment of a debt.

00:10:37.974 --> 00:10:40.257
I owe Frank nothin'.

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:43.093
You had a free choice between
us and you chose me.

00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:45.095
The fact you did shouldna entitle him

00:10:45.097 --> 00:10:48.232
to any particular consideration.

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:52.102
But Frank's innocent in all of this.

00:10:52.154 --> 00:10:55.155
What Randall did to me
was worse than death.

00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:57.942
What lies between him and
me can only be settled

00:10:57.994 --> 00:10:59.827
when one of us is dead.

00:10:59.862 --> 00:11:02.780
So why did you promise me
that you'd let Randall live?

00:11:02.782 --> 00:11:07.284
Because of Charles Stuart.

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:09.253
The prince is a canny, slippery man.

00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:13.007
Yet there's a light in his
eye that can fool good men

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:15.042
to believe he's God's chosen one,

00:11:15.094 --> 00:11:16.377
destined to make the dream

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:19.096
of a Stuart restoration reality.

00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:25.135
We have thwarted him all we can, Claire.

00:11:27.106 --> 00:11:29.807
We may find ourselves
staring into the abyss

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:32.226
awaiting us at the
bottom of Culloden Moor.

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:37.147
So if anything should happen to me...

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:38.983
Don't talk like that.

00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:41.952
I want there to be a place for you.

00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:48.792
Someone to care for you.

00:11:48.828 --> 00:11:50.327
For our bairn.

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:57.251
I want it to be a man that loves you.

00:12:00.222 --> 00:12:02.006
So...

00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:06.143
Now it's my turn to ask
you for a promise.

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.818
Promise me that

00:12:14.854 --> 00:12:18.772
if the time should come,

00:12:18.824 --> 00:12:20.941
you will go back through the stones.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.030
Back to Frank.

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:37.841
I promise.

00:13:24.256 --> 00:13:26.840
Why are we trying to fake smallpox?

00:13:26.892 --> 00:13:29.510
'Cause the financiers are waiting to see

00:13:29.562 --> 00:13:32.980
if the prince's wine
venture is successful.

00:13:33.015 --> 00:13:35.149
If it works, they'll be lining up

00:13:35.184 --> 00:13:36.984
to lend money to the Jacobite cause.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:39.269
But if we can get the
harbor master at Le Havre

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:42.322
to destroy St. Germain's
warehouse and inventory,

00:13:42.358 --> 00:13:43.824
like he did with the Patagonia...

00:13:43.859 --> 00:13:46.026
Charles will lose his
wine and the investment.

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:47.277
And he'll go running back to Rome

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:49.113
with his tail between his legs.

00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:50.998
Or...

00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:54.451
we could slit the Italian fop's
throat and be done with it.

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:57.037
Killing Charles Stuart will
only make him a martyr

00:13:57.089 --> 00:13:59.089
throughout Scotland.

00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:03.510
Essence of rosemary.

00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:08.849
Bitter cascara.

00:14:28.988 --> 00:14:32.372
Mash of nettles.

00:14:32.408 --> 00:14:34.408
If you must.

00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:41.999
Stop fooling around. Pay attention.

00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.502
- I am.
- Bu... but you're not.

00:14:45.554 --> 00:14:46.554
But...

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:53.310
I don't feel anything.

00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:54.511
You will in a minute.

00:15:00.186 --> 00:15:02.653
Rose madder.

00:15:02.688 --> 00:15:04.605
With luck, the combination will cause

00:15:04.657 --> 00:15:06.690
severe stomach pains and vomiting.

00:15:06.742 --> 00:15:09.526
You're in for a pleasant evening.

00:15:13.532 --> 00:15:15.916
Do you think you can get St.
Germain's men to drink it?

00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:17.167
Aye.

00:15:17.203 --> 00:15:19.419
I will break the corks
off a few bottles.

00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:21.371
Canna sell damaged product.

00:15:21.423 --> 00:15:23.624
St. Germain's men will
no let it go to waste.

00:15:23.676 --> 00:15:25.342
Trust me.

00:15:25.377 --> 00:15:27.544
Well, once his men
drink the spiked wine,

00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:29.296
they should flush with fever.

00:15:29.348 --> 00:15:31.965
The nettle juice on their
skin will cause blistering,

00:15:32.017 --> 00:15:34.635
and the rose madder should
produce blood in the urine.

00:15:34.687 --> 00:15:36.553
All telltale symptoms.

00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:53.120
<i>Et voilà,</i>

00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:56.323
I give you smallpox.

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:59.076
Masquerades and games.

00:15:59.078 --> 00:16:01.078
What's next?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.131
A rousing game of charades?

00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:07.251
Yes. Oh, you know, the
ladies at Maison Elise's,

00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:10.254
they play charades without any
clothes on for the clients.

00:16:13.008 --> 00:16:15.142
Quiet, laddie.

00:16:15.177 --> 00:16:16.560
But I was quiet.

00:16:16.595 --> 00:16:18.562
Get.

00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:25.602
Mm.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.411
Murtagh's angry.

00:16:34.446 --> 00:16:35.446
Do not blame him.

00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:51.378
We need to tell him.

00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:58.185
I was just thinking
that exact same thing.

00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:04.641
Aye.

00:17:04.643 --> 00:17:07.361
Everything.

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:09.696
Everything.

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:14.818
Oh.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.560
If you believe...

00:18:30.562 --> 00:18:34.114
yer wife to be a...

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:36.149
a witch...

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:42.622
Then who am I to contradict ye?

00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:55.719
Mm. Mm.

00:18:57.423 --> 00:19:00.757
But you shoulda trusted
me with that knowledge

00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:04.428
from the beginning.

00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:35.425
Be careful.

00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:37.878
- I will.
- You always say that.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.797
Mean it this time.

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:43.884
_

00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:45.385
<i>Moi?</i>

00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:46.803
Yes, you.

00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:48.688
<i>Oui,</i> Milady.

00:19:48.724 --> 00:19:50.607
I will watch over Milord as well.

00:19:52.778 --> 00:19:54.861
You're in good hands.

00:19:54.897 --> 00:19:57.864
- See you in a few days.
- Mm.

00:20:33.685 --> 00:20:38.572
You lived through these years, then?

00:20:38.607 --> 00:20:39.773
Yes.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.361
This is the year I was born.

00:20:44.413 --> 00:20:48.031
And this is the year I became a nurse.

00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:50.500
Healer.

00:20:50.536 --> 00:20:52.536
During a world war.

00:20:56.458 --> 00:21:01.378
Ye ken what happens to the Jacobites.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.763
Yes.

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:05.932
I know when The Rising begins.

00:21:05.968 --> 00:21:09.970
Then ye know how it ends, too.

00:21:10.022 --> 00:21:11.688
And it doesn't end well.

00:21:15.561 --> 00:21:18.528
No.

00:21:18.564 --> 00:21:23.066
Unless we stop it from
happening all together.

00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:25.569
But ye ken all the dates.

00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:27.737
When things will happen.

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.790
When people will die.

00:21:31.994 --> 00:21:35.712
I don't know about you...

00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:39.666
or Jamie...

00:21:39.718 --> 00:21:41.718
about any of us.

00:21:45.807 --> 00:21:49.142
Even knowing what Jamie says ye do...

00:21:51.763 --> 00:21:54.898
I wouldn't want to bear that burden.

00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:33.947
Now, place these bottles

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:37.200
where the men are sure to find them.

00:23:37.202 --> 00:23:40.503
Brush this on the
insides of their coats.

00:23:40.539 --> 00:23:43.506
<i>Careful not to get it on your hands.</i>

00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:24.631
Well...

00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:26.966
success?

00:24:27.002 --> 00:24:29.052
I dinna linger to find out.

00:24:29.087 --> 00:24:31.721
We'll ken soon enough, though.

00:24:31.757 --> 00:24:33.139
It must work.

00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:35.258
Charles can't get his
hands on that money.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.559
Mm.

00:24:36.595 --> 00:24:37.927
Dinna fash,<i> mo nighean donn,</i>

00:24:37.979 --> 00:24:40.146
if anyone can deliver
pestilence and disease...

00:24:40.182 --> 00:24:42.015
It's us.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.193
Come here.

00:24:53.245 --> 00:24:54.245
Mm.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.801
James.

00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:23.641
Your Royal Highness.

00:25:23.692 --> 00:25:25.308
Finally you're here.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.060
I have been anxiously waiting.

00:25:27.112 --> 00:25:29.145
Well, I-I came as soon as
I received your message.

00:25:29.197 --> 00:25:33.116
_

00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:34.984
As I said, I came straightaway.

00:25:34.986 --> 00:25:38.154
_

00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:41.708
How may I be of service?

00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:45.962
There has been a
catastrophe in Le Havre.

00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:47.630
At the comte's warehouse.

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:49.082
_

00:25:49.134 --> 00:25:52.085
A mysterious illness, which
no one has been able

00:25:52.137 --> 00:25:53.336
to diagnose as yet.

00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:56.172
This illness, is it contagious?

00:25:56.174 --> 00:25:57.340
_

00:25:57.342 --> 00:25:58.925
One should not openly speculate

00:25:58.977 --> 00:26:00.810
as to the contagion of this malady.

00:26:00.846 --> 00:26:05.245
_

00:26:05.517 --> 00:26:07.901
How about the harbor master,
has he been paid off?

00:26:07.936 --> 00:26:09.745
Is that not how you normally
handle these things?

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.987
_

00:26:12.012 --> 00:26:14.513
This is why I sent for you, James.

00:26:14.538 --> 00:26:17.705
We require you to transport
the wine at once.

00:26:23.702 --> 00:26:25.835
Hmm.

00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:27.420
Well, this endeavor could jeopardize

00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:29.038
my, uh, cousin Jared's business.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.208
_

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.129
James knows this is no
time for negotiation.

00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:41.856
_

00:26:42.295 --> 00:26:44.342
_

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:48.555
James, you know this is not
merely for financial gain.

00:26:48.628 --> 00:26:50.711
Mark me.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:53.113
The profits from this endeavor

00:26:53.148 --> 00:26:56.700
will be the seed to expel
the Hanoverian usurpers

00:26:56.735 --> 00:26:59.536
to my father's throne.

00:26:59.571 --> 00:27:01.871
This is to regain your soil

00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:04.791
and to restore your blessed king.

00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:10.580
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:12.716
I've yet to secure buyers,

00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:14.084
but I'll leave for Le Havre

00:27:14.136 --> 00:27:18.171
and arrange transfer to my
warehouse straightaway.

00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:22.058
You are a loyal and true patriot, James.

00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:26.179
Godspeed.

00:27:34.656 --> 00:27:36.578
_

00:27:37.867 --> 00:27:39.640
_

00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:44.211
_

00:27:50.205 --> 00:27:52.756
The road to Le Havre is a lonely one.

00:27:52.791 --> 00:27:56.126
Your conversation will provide
a pleasant diversion.

00:28:09.107 --> 00:28:12.225
- These hinder my movements.
- Ye'll get used to it.

00:28:12.227 --> 00:28:13.977
I don't want to get used to it.

00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:15.278
Playing the jessie's bad enough.

00:28:15.313 --> 00:28:17.230
Doin' it in this outfit is unbearable.

00:28:17.232 --> 00:28:20.817
We'll make a proper French
courtier out of you yet.

00:28:20.869 --> 00:28:22.569
- Indeed.
- Another bleat like that

00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:23.953
and I'll see to the
other side of yer jaw.

00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:26.740
Perhaps we can think of an alternative?

00:28:26.742 --> 00:28:28.625
Do you even trust these
men that you've found?

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.745
Money'll buy anything if
ye ken where to look.

00:28:31.747 --> 00:28:34.664
Fine, but do these highwaymen

00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:36.716
even have the proper
attire to look the part?

00:28:36.752 --> 00:28:39.052
Let's just say it'll be a risky affair

00:28:39.087 --> 00:28:42.222
for a nobleman strolling along
the Rue Saint-Honoré tonight.

00:28:42.257 --> 00:28:45.058
We don't have time for
an alternative, Claire.

00:28:45.093 --> 00:28:47.260
And what if you get caught?

00:28:47.312 --> 00:28:49.395
Have either of you thought
of that contingency?

00:28:49.431 --> 00:28:51.931
Aye.

00:28:51.983 --> 00:28:54.818
Don't get caught.

00:28:54.853 --> 00:28:56.269
This whole thing's dangerous.

00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:57.904
'Tis.

00:28:59.741 --> 00:29:02.325
Every now and then it is okay
for you to lie to me, you know?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.694
Just to put my mind at ease.

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:06.946
I'll remember that next time.

00:29:06.948 --> 00:29:10.033
I don't feel good about this.

00:29:11.419 --> 00:29:12.919
This feels...

00:29:12.954 --> 00:29:15.255
Needlessly risky,

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.875
like we haven't thought
it through enough.

00:29:18.927 --> 00:29:20.293
What about St. Germain?

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:22.796
We do have a plan for him.

00:29:22.848 --> 00:29:26.432
I have thought it through,
and it'll serve, Sassenach.

00:29:26.468 --> 00:29:28.852
But I am not the one ye
should be concerned about.

00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:31.805
I'm simply a merchant
transporting his goods.

00:29:31.807 --> 00:29:34.357
And if you feel obliged,

00:29:34.392 --> 00:29:37.143
say your prayers for
Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:39.863
He'll be the one in the line of fire.

00:29:42.317 --> 00:29:44.651
If I do happen to get caught,

00:29:44.703 --> 00:29:46.452
would you be so kind as to kill me?

00:29:46.488 --> 00:29:48.738
I refuse to be hanged in this rig out.

00:29:51.243 --> 00:29:53.042
Then let me get you undressed,

00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:55.078
right away.

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:07.006
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:30:09.928 --> 00:30:11.928
It's just...

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.231
bad things tend to
happen when we're apart.

00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:19.853
We find a way back to each other, no?

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.905
- Hm.
- Hm.

00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:26.492
Was that...

00:30:26.528 --> 00:30:28.361
Did he?

00:30:28.363 --> 00:30:31.197
Yes,<i> she</i> did.

00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:34.951
She's been doing it a lot more recently.

00:30:35.003 --> 00:30:36.369
Can he hear me?

00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:41.291
A daughter.

00:30:41.343 --> 00:30:42.375
Wee un...

00:30:44.262 --> 00:30:46.262
It's your father.

00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:52.385
Cannae wait to meet ye.

00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:16.793
Can we?

00:31:19.047 --> 00:31:20.129
With the bairn?

00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:22.799
It's fine.

00:31:22.834 --> 00:31:24.834
You won't hurt us.

00:31:36.181 --> 00:31:39.182

00:31:39.207 --> 00:31:41.689

00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:16.886
Hup, hup. All right.

00:32:29.401 --> 00:32:32.402
- _ - _

00:32:32.427 --> 00:32:33.988

00:33:36.608 --> 00:33:37.819

00:33:39.678 --> 00:33:40.896

00:33:45.037 --> 00:33:48.724

00:33:54.297 --> 00:33:56.452

00:33:57.717 --> 00:33:59.772
_

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.630
_

00:34:02.655 --> 00:34:04.013

00:34:04.513 --> 00:34:05.522

00:34:06.718 --> 00:34:10.717

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.904
_

00:34:14.334 --> 00:34:17.397
_

00:34:20.678 --> 00:34:23.396
Doesn't it distress any of you?

00:34:23.431 --> 00:34:27.350
How this city treats its
poor and underprivileged?

00:34:27.402 --> 00:34:30.103
I mean, surely you must see the
staggering numbers of them

00:34:30.105 --> 00:34:33.773
as you travel through the city.

00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:37.243
Just yesterday, I-I saw
a woman and her child

00:34:37.278 --> 00:34:39.612
dead in the middle of the road.

00:34:42.417 --> 00:34:44.534
It was absolutely horrible.

00:34:47.255 --> 00:34:50.289
Surely we must do something
to change the situation.

00:34:52.627 --> 00:34:54.794
Madame Fraser...

00:34:54.796 --> 00:34:56.518
_

00:34:56.745 --> 00:34:58.737
_

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.440
_

00:35:01.127 --> 00:35:04.799
_

00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:07.354
_

00:35:09.144 --> 00:35:11.444
The<i> gen d'armes</i> should remove them

00:35:11.479 --> 00:35:15.198
to the less desirable parts of the city.

00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:27.076
Is it time?

00:35:27.128 --> 00:35:29.378
No, it's not the baby.

00:35:29.414 --> 00:35:31.414
It's just that...

00:35:33.668 --> 00:35:35.585
Sorry, Louise.

00:35:35.637 --> 00:35:38.721
Forgive me.

00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:42.391
_

00:35:45.812 --> 00:35:47.824
_

00:36:17.845 --> 00:36:21.264
Claire, you must sit. Come rest.

00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:22.715
Mother, yes, I will.

00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:24.477
I just have to attend
to a few more patients.

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:26.636
If you do not want to
become one yourself,

00:36:26.688 --> 00:36:29.222
you'll do as I say.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.403
Lie down.

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:45.788
You are bleeding, my dear.

00:36:49.918 --> 00:36:52.753
It is nothing to be concerned with.

00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:57.419
As you know, it is common to
leak a bit at this stage.

00:36:57.635 --> 00:37:02.421
<i>Votre petit</i> is taking a
new position, I suspect.

00:37:02.423 --> 00:37:04.257
The hour is late.

00:37:04.259 --> 00:37:06.309
You will stay here tonight.

00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:09.812
- No, I can't.
- That was not a suggestion.

00:37:12.233 --> 00:37:14.517
Then I should send
word home with Fergus.

00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:16.269
My husband will worry.

00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:18.904
I will see to that.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.906
Sleep. Now.

00:37:36.322 --> 00:37:40.608
<i>I will be</i> persona non
grata <i>with the bankers of Paris.</i>

00:37:43.431 --> 00:37:46.966
An outcast at worst.

00:37:47.018 --> 00:37:48.601
Surely there will always be those

00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:49.852
that honor the Stuart name.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.309
The French honor money only.

00:37:56.361 --> 00:38:01.314
_

00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:04.134
'Tis the most common road
taken from Le Havre to Paris.

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:06.978
_

00:38:07.009 --> 00:38:11.299
_

00:38:12.111 --> 00:38:14.283
_

00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:15.308
Aye.

00:38:15.845 --> 00:38:19.751
_

00:38:23.377 --> 00:38:24.775
_

00:38:26.064 --> 00:38:27.080
_

00:38:28.447 --> 00:38:31.713
_

00:38:32.764 --> 00:38:35.648
False accusations can lead
to dire consequences,

00:38:35.683 --> 00:38:37.483
Monsieur St. Germain.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.619
_

00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:44.273
Comte, by your own account,

00:38:44.325 --> 00:38:48.527
Lord Broch Tuarach saved you
from injury or even death.

00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:50.329
Why should he risk himself?

00:38:56.671 --> 00:38:59.038
This discord,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.425
it will not recover my wine.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:06.796
Our king and God have been let down.

00:39:06.848 --> 00:39:11.517
All the sacrifices I made
these last months in France,

00:39:11.552 --> 00:39:14.053
lowering myself to a commoner,

00:39:14.105 --> 00:39:17.022
begging for money,

00:39:17.058 --> 00:39:19.775
have amounted to naught.

00:39:21.446 --> 00:39:24.113
So where will the House of Stuart stand

00:39:24.148 --> 00:39:27.450
if our cause fails?

00:39:27.485 --> 00:39:29.869
I will be forced to return home to Rome,

00:39:29.904 --> 00:39:33.956
where even the pope's goodwill
for my father begins to run dry.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.627
Or worse...

00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:43.582
Mark me, I will take my own life

00:39:43.634 --> 00:39:47.470
if I am forced to live
in God-forsaken Poland.

00:40:10.495 --> 00:40:11.495
Hmm.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.991
Good morning, Milord.

00:40:19.704 --> 00:40:21.587
Where's Milady?

00:40:21.622 --> 00:40:25.124
Staying the night at the hospital.

00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:27.543
No, no, no, no, no, no.
The hour was late,

00:40:27.595 --> 00:40:30.880
so the Mother thought it
best if Milady remains,

00:40:30.932 --> 00:40:33.766
so not to travel the streets at night.

00:40:33.801 --> 00:40:35.384
I allowed it.

00:40:35.436 --> 00:40:38.938
Well, I was wise to leave
my wife in your charge.

00:40:47.064 --> 00:40:48.981
You hungry?

00:40:48.983 --> 00:40:51.033
Always.

00:40:51.068 --> 00:40:52.068
Go on.

00:40:56.207 --> 00:40:57.573
Ah.

00:41:00.244 --> 00:41:02.661
When will Murtagh be home?

00:41:02.663 --> 00:41:05.998
Mm. Aye, he's gone to
Portugal to sell the wine.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.552
Could be a month or two
before he returns.

00:41:11.973 --> 00:41:13.973
I will miss his happy face.

00:41:16.561 --> 00:41:20.012
It's best he's not seen here for a time.

00:41:20.064 --> 00:41:24.934
Milady says, "out of
sight, out of mind."

00:41:24.986 --> 00:41:27.686
Never heard her say that.

00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:29.188
Says it to me every day.

00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:33.192
Pardon, Milord.

00:41:33.194 --> 00:41:34.493
I don't mean to interrupt your meal.

00:41:34.529 --> 00:41:36.529
It's fine.

00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:44.003
Prince Charles has got himself
into some trouble at the salon.

00:41:44.038 --> 00:41:47.172
Seems he's run up a substantial
debt and refuses to pay.

00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:49.792
Madame Elise has threatened
to call for the<i> gens d'armes</i>

00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:54.713
unless restitution is made i...
immediately.

00:41:54.715 --> 00:41:57.550
No peace for the wicked.

00:41:57.602 --> 00:41:59.101
<i>Merci.</i>

00:42:01.022 --> 00:42:03.055
Shall I go as proxy, Milord?

00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:06.892
So you... you can finish
your meal and rest?

00:42:06.944 --> 00:42:10.195
No. Best go myself.

00:42:10.231 --> 00:42:12.064
We don't want the<i> gens
d'armes</i> making inquiries

00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:14.199
into our business affairs...

00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:16.118
today, of all days.

00:42:16.153 --> 00:42:19.238
Then I shall come with you.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:21.040
To guard your right.

00:42:21.075 --> 00:42:22.908
I'll be honored.

00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:36.255
_

00:42:39.143 --> 00:42:40.759
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:58.303
- Good afternoon, Magnus.
- Milady.

00:44:14.071 --> 00:44:15.854
Milady, forgive me.

00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:17.356
I did not know you had arrived home.

00:44:17.358 --> 00:44:19.825
That's all right.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.194
Do you wish a bath?

00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:23.746
Perhaps something to eat?

00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:27.332
Where is Milord?

00:44:27.368 --> 00:44:29.368
Suzette...

00:44:30.788 --> 00:44:32.204
My husband's brace is there.

00:44:32.206 --> 00:44:33.706
He's obviously back from Le Havre.

00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:35.758
Where is he?

00:44:37.211 --> 00:44:40.212
Milord has gone to the<i> Bois de Boulogne.</i>

00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:43.882
Now why would he go to the woods?

00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:48.137
Milord was called to Maison Elise.

00:44:48.189 --> 00:44:50.222
Prince Charles needed his help.

00:44:50.274 --> 00:44:52.307
Soon after he arrived,

00:44:52.359 --> 00:44:55.944
Milord got into a fight
with an English officer.

00:45:03.037 --> 00:45:05.037
What English officer?

00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:09.792
What was his name?

00:45:11.495 --> 00:45:12.461
Suzette?

00:45:12.496 --> 00:45:14.797
I wasn't there, Milady.

00:45:14.832 --> 00:45:16.498
Marie told me at the market earlier.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.884
She overheard this master
telling his wife everything...

00:45:18.919 --> 00:45:22.054
Just, Goddamnit, tell me what happened.

00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:27.392
The English soldier came
hurtling out of a doorway,

00:45:27.428 --> 00:45:29.094
smashing into the walls.

00:45:29.096 --> 00:45:33.148
Then Milord appeared looking
like the vengeance of God.

00:45:33.184 --> 00:45:35.150
It is just as Marie conveyed it.

00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:40.105
He must.

00:45:40.107 --> 00:45:42.908
You promised.

00:45:42.943 --> 00:45:44.943
Milady, are you unwell?

00:45:51.168 --> 00:45:53.168
Milady?

00:45:55.122 --> 00:45:57.039
Mm.

00:45:57.091 --> 00:45:59.458
Magnus, the carriage.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.509
I'm going to the<i> Bois de Boulogne.</i>

00:46:00.544 --> 00:46:02.377
Milord wouldn't want you to.

00:46:02.429 --> 00:46:04.930
Milady, you cannot go by yourself.

00:46:04.965 --> 00:46:08.467
Then come along, but I am going now.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.472
_

00:46:55.649 --> 00:46:59.268
God damn you.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.353
You promised me.

00:47:04.441 --> 00:47:06.441
You promised me.

00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:17.509
_

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:20.088
_

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.567
This way, Milady.

00:47:48.569 --> 00:47:51.536
Quickly. Quickly.

00:48:13.594 --> 00:48:16.595
<i>I came through the
fading light to find this,</i>

00:48:16.597 --> 00:48:19.181
<i>to stop them.</i>

00:48:19.233 --> 00:48:22.267
<i>Having found them, I could not intervene</i>

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:24.686
<i>for fear of causing fatal interruption.</i>

00:48:26.156 --> 00:48:27.439
Milady?

00:48:27.441 --> 00:48:29.408
<i>All I could do is wait,</i>

00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:31.944
<i>to see which of my men would die,</i>

00:48:31.946 --> 00:48:35.113
<i>Jamie or Frank.</i>

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.260
Aah!

00:48:54.768 --> 00:48:56.551
How did she forgive you?

00:49:00.808 --> 00:49:02.140
Huh?

00:49:02.192 --> 00:49:04.309
Ja...

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.674
Milady...

00:49:40.064 --> 00:49:41.480
Aah!

00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:53.045
Jamie!

00:49:53.695 --> 00:49:57.055
_

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.541
_

00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:02.250
Claire?

00:50:02.286 --> 00:50:04.369
Milady? Milady?

00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:05.587
_

00:50:05.746 --> 00:50:06.962
Claire!

00:50:06.987 --> 00:50:08.620
_

00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:11.353
- Claire!
- _

00:50:11.378 --> 00:50:13.628
I have to get you home, Milady.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.182
- Claire!
- <i>L'Hôpital,</i> Mother Hildegarde.

00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:20.281
_

00:50:20.306 --> 00:50:21.472
Claire!

00:50:24.475 --> 00:50:25.524
Jamie.

00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:30.862
Jamie.

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.170
